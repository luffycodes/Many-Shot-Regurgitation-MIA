Define nutrition.
Identify key events in the history of nutrition.

A Basic Definition of Nutrition
Nutrition is the intake of food to meet the needs of the body. Accordingly, nutrients are substances found in foods and beverages that are essential for survival (Anatomy and Physiology 2e, 2022). Nurses must understand the components of nutrition and its impact on bodily functions to provide effective nursing care.
Several food-related concepts are fundamental to understanding how nutrition affects the body (Anatomy and Physiology 2e, 2022). The term food refers to edible substances made of protein, carbohydrates, fat, or other nutrients. Food is comprised of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Macronutrients are water and energy-yielding nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) needed in large amounts by the body. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. Food is the building block of the diet which describes the quantity and quality of food and drinks consumed.
Nutrition in Foods
Understanding calories is essential to understanding how the body uses nutrients for fuel. Calories, which measure the amount of heat it takes to raise 1 kg of water by 1ºC, are used to indicate the amount of energy needed or ingested daily (Anatomy and Physiology 2e, 2022). Human bodies need calories to function, digest food, grow, and move. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines issued jointly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2021) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USHHS, n.d.) recommend adult women consume an estimated 1,600 to 2,400 calories daily and adult men 2,000 to 3,000 calories daily based on age and activity level.
The number of calories found in food varies based on food type.  lists the number of calories found in macronutrients. Food preparation can modify the number of calories present. For example, a raw tomato has fewer calories than a fried tomato. Water is classified as a macronutrient. Although it serves a vital role, it does not provide energy to the body.

The History of Nutrition in the Provision of Client Care
Modern nutrition science advanced significantly during the 20th century (Mozaffarian, Rosenberg & Uauy, 2018). The identification of essential vitamins and minerals in the early 1900s launched the quest to identify and treat vitamin-deficient medical conditions such as beriberi. Subsequent nutritional discoveries led to the practice of fortifying certain foods to prevent deficiencies and setting the first recommended dietary allowances (RDAs).
During this same timeframe, the federal government began to oversee and manage the food supply. In 1906, the Pure Food and Drugs Act was passed, which launched the federal regulation of foods by the agency later known as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2018). The FDA was initially established to oversee how food was prepared for consumers. This became necessary as more people moved from rural to urban areas, they depended on others to grow and produce the food they needed.
In 1938, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of 1938 was passed, significantly enhancing labeling requirements. The FDCA required food labels to include the product’s recognizable name and standardized information related to the identity, quality, and amount in the container (Lam & Patel, 2022).
Later, in the second half of the 20th century, the focus of nutrition shifted toward nutrition and its relationship to health (USDA and USHHS, n.d.). In 1977, the first-ever federal guidance related to diet quality was published in Dietary Goals for the United States. These goals were intended to improve the typical American diet to decrease the incidence of heart disease. The development of these goals prompted pushback from some members of the food industry. For example, the goals originally recommended to reduce the intake of red meat in the diet. However, groups such as the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, opposed this recommendation since it would negatively affect the beef industry. Consequently, the language in the federal guidelines was changed from minimizing red meat to selecting foods that will minimize saturated fat intake (Stillerman, 2019).
Continuing this new shift in perspective in 1982, the Committee on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer, National Research Council presented their findings on the relationship between diet and cancer. These findings served as a foundation to promote nutritional factors and dietary needs that decrease the incidence of cancer. Not only did the report discuss foods linked to the potential development of cancer, but it also identified foods that supported cancer prevention. This study specifically mentioned macronutrients and micronutrients found in the diet and their impact on cancer development and/or prevention. This introduction of macronutrients and micronutrients to the public facilitated several agencies to take active roles in promoting dietary agendas. For example, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prompted all food packaging entities to label foods with nutritional information and serving sizes.
Through the years, visual displays of government food guides have been modified to reflect the changing perspectives. The first guide, released in the 1940s, divided foods into seven groups and encouraged people to eat foods from all groups as well as food not included in the seven groups without specifying amounts. The widely recognized Food Guide Pyramid was first introduced in the 1990s and underwent several revisions until it was replaced by MyPlate in 2011 (Davis & Saltos, n.d.; USDA, 2021). The most recent dietary guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025, uses the original MyPlate visual guide to recommend small, simple changes to improve diet quality.

Nutrition for Wellness
The Global Wellness Institute defines wellness as pursuing activities, choices, and lifestyles leading to holistic health. Multiple factors influence a person’s health, including nutrition. Good nutrition is essential for keeping the population healthy (CDC, 2021).
Origin of Nutrition Related to Wellness
The ancient Greek physician who influenced much of modern medicine, Hippocrates, is credited with saying, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” (King, 2019). This appears to be one of the earliest statements acknowledging the role of nutrition in maintaining health. In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO, n.d.). This definition reflected a growing emphasis on a holistic perspective of health.
Weight Versus Body Mass Index
Several measurements are recognized and used to assess a person’s nutritional status and identify individuals at risk for illness or disease. These indicators go beyond simply measuring a person’s weight to assess body composition and weight distribution. Body mass index (BMI) is a formula that calculates the ratio of weight and height to classify individuals as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese. The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) calculates the ratio of the circumferences of the waist to the hip. Evidence has shown that individuals with excess weight around their midsection may be at higher risk for certain health conditions. These simple assessments can be done at home or with a healthcare provider to gain important information on the status of an individual’s dietary-related health.
BMI and Diverse Populations
Recently, the routine use of BMI as a lone indicator of obesity has been scrutinized as a result of research that shows BMI may not be a reliable indicator for diverse populations. The American Medical Association (AMA) has adopted a new policy clarifying the use of BMI as one means of identifying obesity. The policy states that BMI should not be used exclusively to identify obesity; instead, it should be used in conjunction with other assessment tools. The policy acknowledges the BMI assessment is based on data from non-Hispanic White populations and does not consider differences in body shape and composition across different race/ethnic groups, sexes, or age groups (AMA, 2023).
Calculating BMI
BMI is a screening tool used to identify clients who are overweight or obese. Considering the recent policy change by the AMA, nurses should stay abreast of new research to determine how to incorporate BMI measurements when working with diverse client populations. BMI does not measure body fat directly but correlates with other more direct measures of body fat such as skinfold thickness measurements. High BMI can be correlated with obesity-linked adverse health outcomes. To determine BMI, input the client’s height and weight into the Adult BMI Calculator. Use  to interpret the results.

Measuring WHR
Clients may be self-conscious about having body measurements taken. Provide privacy for your client when taking these measurements. To determine WHR, with the client standing upright, use a tape measure to measure the distance around the smallest part of the client’s waist (waist circumference) and then the largest part of the client’s hip (hip circumference). Then divide the waist circumference by the hip circumference or use this online calculator to determine the WHR. The result is determined using .

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Discuss the interdisciplinary nature of nutrition and client care.
Approach nutrition in nursing practice using the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) Clinical Judgment Model.

An Interdisciplinary Team Approach to Meeting Client’s Nutritional Needs
The nurse is one part of an interdisciplinary team caring for the client. Nutrition affects all aspects of a person’s care. Decisions made by each practitioner affect the client’s nutritional status and influence decisions by other team members. A coordinated, interdisciplinary approach can improve healthcare quality and outcomes (Bendowska & Baum, 2023).
Although the primary health care provider (PCP) typically orders a specific diet for clients to follow, the PCP will often have a dietitian meet with the client to review their history, physical examination, and lab values to determine a nutrition care plan for the client. Additional input regarding nutrition may be obtained from other members of the team based upon their area of expertise and the client’s needs. The nurse can work with the client and family to identify preferences and likelihood of adherence to a specific diet regime. The nurse can assist the client in understanding specific benefits of nutritional recommendations, as well as develop a plan for the client to adopt healthy eating into their lifestyle.
Interdisciplinary Team Introduction
Dietary evaluation can begin in either the acute care setting or outpatient setting. When started in the acute care setting, a nutritional plan (meal plan) is generally developed to address a specific need with a short-term goal. For example, a client with chronic congestive heart failure experiencing an acute exacerbation would need to decrease sodium consumption to decrease fluid retention. Dietary evaluation in the outpatient setting can help develop a plan that focuses on steps that yield long-term goals. For example, a client diagnosed with Class 1 obesity could benefit from weight reduction to decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Or, a patient already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes could benefit from dietary counseling as an intervention to manage the condition. See  for an example of the roles of an interdisciplinary team.

Integrative nutrition combines medical nutritional therapy with functional medicine and other disciplines to provide education and guidance for a personalized diet based on whole foods and lifestyle recommendations (Center for Integrative Nutrition, n.d.). The integrative nutrition approach supports a multidisciplinary approach to managing nutrition. Evidence-based practice (EBP) involves using the best evidence to deliver healthcare (Chien, 2019). Nutritional interventions should be based on evidence to improve patient outcomes.

The integrative nutrition approach supports a multidisciplinary approach to managing nutrition. Evidence-based practice (EBP) involves using the best evidence to deliver healthcare (Chien, 2019). Nutritional interventions should be based on evidence to improve patient outcomes.

Clinical Nursing Practice and Integrative Nutritional Essentials
Nursing practice has always had a holistic focus (Thornton, 2019). With this perspective, the nurse should view the client’s physical and nutritional status in concert with other factors, consistent with the framework of integrative nutrition. In a holistic practice, psychological, social, and cultural factors should be addressed when working with clients to develop a nutritional plan (meal plan).

The National Council of State Boards of Nursing Clinical Judgment Model
The NCSBN developed the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (NCJMM) in conjunction with the updated National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). This model is an evidence-based tool for NCLEX testing and pre-licensure preparation. The model is used to evaluate prospective entry-level nurses’ clinical judgment and decision-making ability (NCSBN, 2023).
NCJMM Overview
The NCJMM adds complexity and clinical context to NCLEX testing items to better simulate real-world practice (NCSBN, 2019). This NCJMM video provides an overview of the model. Understanding the model can better prepare nurses to take the NCLEX and apply what was learned in school to post graduate work.
Nursing Process
The nursing process represents a five-step approach to client-centered care: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation (Toney-Butler & Thayer, 2023). During the assessment phase, most health and medical history questions are relevant to the client’s nutritional status. Questions specifically related to nutrition are those asking for a dietary recall (record of what the client has eaten during a specified timeframe) or asking about food frequency (how much of a food is consumed how often). Other relevant questions include questions about food preferences, food preparation ability and concerns, how the client accesses food, and cultural and religious concerns related to nutrition. Again, many aspects of the physical assessment are related to nutrition. However, the nurse can easily collect assessment findings directly related to nutrition: height, weight, and other body measurements such as waist-hip measurements.
NCSBN Clinical Judgment Model Identification
The NCJMM has expanded the traditional nursing process model to focus on clinical judgment and to align more closely with real-world nursing practice (Ignatavicius & Silvestri, 2023).
This educational resource will use the NCJMM as the framework to drive nursing care. The NCJMM provides a systematic approach to assess the client, analyze their situation, and form a plan of care incorporating best EBP.
NCJMM and NCLEX Exam

Nursing Process
The nursing process represents a five-step approach to client-centered care: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation (Toney-Butler & Thayer, 2023). During the assessment phase, most health and medical history questions are relevant to the client’s nutritional status. Questions specifically related to nutrition are those asking for a dietary recall (record of what the client has eaten during a specified timeframe) or asking about food frequency (how much of a food is consumed how often). Other relevant questions include questions about food preferences, food preparation ability and concerns, how the client accesses food, and cultural and religious concerns related to nutrition. Again, many aspects of the physical assessment are related to nutrition. However, the nurse can easily collect assessment findings directly related to nutrition: height, weight, and other body measurements such as waist-hip measurements.

NCSBN Clinical Judgment Model Identification
The NCJMM has expanded the traditional nursing process model to focus on clinical judgment and to align more closely with real-world nursing practice (Ignatavicius & Silvestri, 2023).
This educational resource will use the NCJMM as the framework to drive nursing care. The NCJMM provides a systematic approach to assess the client, analyze their situation, and form a plan of care incorporating best EBP.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Identify the roles that government agencies and nonprofit organizations play in the creation, implementation, and enforcement of nutritional regulations.
Describe current USDA dietary guidelines, including MyPlate.
Analyze the primary sources of consumer nutrition information.
Assess the importance of client education for promoting healthy nutritional habits.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture
It is difficult to separate an individual from the community when assessing personal ability to meet nutritional needs. Factors such as food accessibility, ability to prepare foods, and traditional dietary preferences play a role in how a client can adopt a dietary lifestyle conducive to health and wellness. Government regulations and programs and the availability of appropriate consumer nutritional education can influence these factors.
The USDA leads 29 agencies that oversee food production and consumption. The USDA (n.d.) recognizes poor nutrition as a substantial factor in illness in the U.S.—poor nutrition is linked to diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. These illnesses impact the nation more broadly by decreasing productivity and increasing health care costs. To foster health, the USDA promotes research to build support and collaboration to provide all Americans equitable access to healthy foods. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service works to address food insecurity and provide evidence-based nutritional guidance to consumers (USDA Food and Nutrition Service, n.d.).
As part of the USDA’s commitment to connecting all Americans with access to affordable, healthy food, the USDA manages programs designed to provide Americans of limited income or with special needs with healthy food. For example, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides a monthly allotment for enrollees to purchase certain nutrient-dense foods. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) provides nutritional, low-cost, or free lunches to eligible school-age children.  lists food assistance programs available through the USDA for qualified individuals.

USDA Resources for Food Assistance Programs
The USDA also plays an essential role in regulating food production and distribution to ensure food quality and safety. The Food Safety and Inspection Service is the primary USDA agency that enforces safe processing and packing regulations of meat, poultry, and egg products.
The USDA actively promotes nutrition through educational materials. From the provision of curricula available for school-age children in both English and Spanish, Team Nutrition—an initiative to support child nutrition—utilizes visually appealing materials to promote nutrition various ways.
As mentioned in this chapter, the USDA released Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025. The Guidelines are designed for policymakers and health professionals to assist in their efforts to promote a healthy, nutritious diet (USDA and USHHS, 2020). MyPlate, a resource directed towards consumers and based on the Guidelines, provides practical information on nutritious foods for consumers to use daily. The MyPlate campaign uses the image of a plate colorfully sectioned into recommended proportions of food for a nutritious meal. Fruits and vegetables comprise half of the plate, grains are approximately one fourth of the plate, and protein occupies the remaining section. Low-fat or fat-free dairy is represented by a glass next to the plate. The MyPlate website encourages everyone to “start simple with MyPlate” and “make every bite count” (USDA, n.d.).
Cultural Food Traditions
The USDA recognizes the importance of incorporating cultural food traditions when planning a healthy diet. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 are meant to be a framework for individuals to use to plan meals that are nutritious yet reflective of their culture/ethnic food preferences. To assist with educating clients from diverse backgrounds, MyPlate educational materials are available in many different languages.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
One of the oldest U.S. government agencies is the FDA which has been the driving force behind labeling. Earlier versions of food labels focused solely on listing accurate ingredients. In recent years, labels have evolved to provide more detailed nutritional information to consumers. The FDA recently updated the Nutrition Facts label on packaged food and drinks to incorporate current research and public input (). The changes were designed to make it easier for consumers to make good food choices to improve health and wellness. In addition to the new changes, the FDA also engaged in a campaign to strategically support consumer education to decrease poor nutrition that contributes to disease and death.
New Nutrition Facts Label
This is a 30-second “commercial” designed to highlight key changes in the new Nutrition Facts label. Watch the New Nutrition Facts Label Video to see how nutrition information can be presented in an entertaining format.
The FDA updated the Nutrition Facts label in 2016. (credit: “On May 20, 2016, the FDA announced the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease”/U.S. FDA, Public Domain)

In addition to consumer education, the FDA offers professional continuing education on the new Nutrition Facts label. Visit Healthcare Professionals | FDA to access educational materials designed to help healthcare professionals understand the new label and how to incorporate it into their practice.

U.S. Nonprofit Organizations
Nonprofit organizations work to advance good nutrition through advocacy for pro-nutrition policies and providing consumer education and wellness promotion. These organizations may focus solely on nutrition or on reducing the effects of illness and disease. For example, in 2006, the American Heart Association promoted health via nutrition by presenting the Diet and Lifestyle Goals for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction. These guidelines, reviewed and updated in 2021, recommend the following nutritional recommendations as part of a comprehensive plan to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease:
A variety of fruits and vegetables
Whole grains
Healthy sources of protein (mostly plants, nuts, fish and seafood, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and lean unprocessed meat and poultry)
Liquid non-tropical vegetable oils
Minimally processed foods
Minimal added sugar intake
Foods prepared with little or no salt
Limited or preferably no alcohol intake (AHA, 2023)
Health care organizations also provide free nutritional resources. For example, Johns Hopkins Medicine offers Health, a vast online resource discussing healthy eating, vitamin use, diets for specific illnesses, and consumer tips.  lists nonprofit websites to explore available information related to nutrition, health, and wellness.

Nonprofit Websites Providing Nutritional Information

Consumer Health Information
The trend toward consumer awareness and personal responsibility has dramatically affected how food and nutrition are currently promoted. Nurses can use the wealth of available resources to promote a healthy relationship with food for individuals, families, and populations.
Consumer health information is widely available through the Internet and other media sources (television, podcasts, magazines, etc.). When using consumer health resources, first assess the scientific validity of the information (North Dakota State University, 2019). For all media sources, the author or speaker should be qualified to write or speak on the topic, and the research sources supporting the material should be clearly identified. Online information should come from a reputable website. Government websites (ending in.gov), educational organization websites (ending in.edu), and nonprofit agencies (ending in.org) are considered the most reliable sources of online information.
The nurse should instruct clients to review nutritional information with a questioning attitude. Clients should be wary of nutritional information that includes any of the following:
Strategies that sound too good to be true
Nutritional recommendations that are too simplistic or dramatic, and unlikely to be supported by scientific evidence
Identifying specific foods as “good” or “bad”
Nutritional guidance that is promoted by nonscience-based testimonials or celebrities or that has supporting research “underway”
Guidance not supported by more than one study and not recommended by reputable scientific organizations North Dakota State University. (2019)
Of course, even the most accurate information may not be appropriate for a particular client. The nurse should use clinical judgment to determine whether the nutritional information applies to the client’s situation. Additionally, the nurse should consider the client’s literacy level and the ability to understand what is being explained.
Health Literacy
An essential factor in the effectiveness of labeling or any health education is the ability of the client to read and understand the information. Health literacy is the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions (USHHS, ODPHP, 2021). In 2010, the USHHS released a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy. Fundamental to this plan is the belief that all people have the right to make informed decisions and that health services should be delivered in ways that support this right. Services should be provided in ways that are easy to understand and that promote healthy living (USHHS, ODPHP, 2021). Accordingly, limited health literacy is linked to poor health outcomes (USHHS, ODPHP, 2021).
Improve Communication with Health Professionals
Helping clients communicate with the health care professionals they work with will improve their care and health-related outcomes. Encourage clients to use these strategies to promote good communication:
Recommend the client write down or record information during their visit.
Encourage the client to ask questions if something is not clear. Have the client confirm who to call if questions arise later.
Advise the client to let the health care team know if the client does not understand what is being said. If the information is confusing or complicated, ask for materials written in plain language that does not include medical terminology.
Suggest that someone accompanies the client to their next appointment (if appropriate). This person can help take notes and ask questions. If the client does not speak the same language as the health care provider, an interpreter credentialed for health care services is needed. Family members should not be expected to act as medical interpreters. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2010)
Client Readiness to Learn and Client Teaching Strategies
Nurses should ensure clients have the skills and knowledge they need to participate effectively in their health care (Hendler, 2022). However, attempting to teach clients when they are not interested in learning is challenging. Accordingly, the nurse’s overall client assessment involves determining the client’s readiness to learn. The following questions can help the nurse identify cues relevant to learning readiness:
Does the client express an interest in the subject?
Does the client ask relevant questions?
Is the client’s body language consistent with someone who is paying attention?
Does the client appear distracted and disinterested?
To try to increase the client’s interest in learning, the nurse should take time to establish rapport. The nurse should ask the client questions to learn more about the client’s preferences and needs and explain the benefits of learning the material.
Assessing readiness to learn is part of a more extensive assessment that should occur when preparing to teach clients. Hendler (2022) summarizes an approach to effective teaching:
Assess the client’s learning style.
Determine the client’s strengths and weaknesses.
Identify the client’s learning needs.
Identify any relevant cultural or religious considerations.
During the teaching session the nurse should do the following:
Use appropriate resources for the client’s situation and literacy level. Obtain an interpreter who is credentialed in medical interpretation if needed.
Involve family or close friends in the session when possible since they are involved in the client’s health care and daily living.
Communicate using plain language that minimizes the use of medical jargon.
If possible, teach the content over multiple sessions.
Evaluation of Effectiveness of Client Teaching
The nurse should evaluate client teaching to determine if the client has understand the information and applied it to their life. Most frequently, client teaching is evaluated using feedback from the client. This can be verbal feedback. For example, can the client answer relevant questions correctly? The nurse could have the client explain in their own words what the nurse has said; the nurse could also demonstrate the material taught, if applicable. If possible, the nurse should check in with the client later to monitor progress and answer any additional questions. Also, the nurse should monitor any relevant client outcomes. For example, have blood glucose levels or hemoglobin A1C levels improved after instructing a client with newly diagnosed diabetes on diet management of the condition?

Holistic Assessment of Cultural Considerations
A client’s culture is intertwined with their health, requiring providers to continually learn more about their values, beliefs, and ways of life (Gbareen, Barnoy & Theilla, 2021). A cultural assessment involves more than identifying any language barriers. The nurse should seek to understand the client’s perspective, preferences, or social norms that are part of the client’s life and affect the client’s food preparation and consumption.

(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2010) Client Readiness to Learn and Client Teaching Strategies Nurses should ensure clients have the skills and knowledge they need to participate effectively in their health care (Hendler, 2022). However, attempting to teach clients when they are not interested in learning is challenging. Accordingly, the nurse’s overall client assessment involves determining the client’s readiness to learn. The following questions can help the nurse identify cues relevant to learning readiness: Does the client express an interest in the subject? Does the client ask relevant questions? Is the client’s body language consistent with someone who is paying attention? Does the client appear distracted and disinterested? To try to increase the client’s interest in learning, the nurse should take time to establish rapport. The nurse should ask the client questions to learn more about the client’s preferences and needs and explain the benefits of learning the material. Assessing readiness to learn is part of a more extensive assessment that should occur when preparing to teach clients. Hendler (2022) summarizes an approach to effective teaching: Assess the client’s learning style. Determine the client’s strengths and weaknesses. Identify the client’s learning needs. Identify any relevant cultural or religious considerations. During the teaching session the nurse should do the following: Use appropriate resources for the client’s situation and literacy level. Obtain an interpreter who is credentialed in medical interpretation if needed. Involve family or close friends in the session when possible since they are involved in the client’s health care and daily living. Communicate using plain language that minimizes the use of medical jargon. If possible, teach the content over multiple sessions.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Assess the impact of food insecurity on health and food choices.
Describe ways to promote food security.

Social Determinants of Health
Nurses must consider that clients’ health problems can be affected by nonmedical factors. Individual clients are part of larger groups whose health is affected by social, demographic, and environmental forces. Unfortunately, certain populations are more likely to experience negative health outcomes related to these influences.
Social determinants of health (SDOH) are nonmedical factors that affect individuals’ health (USHHS, 2021; ODNPHP, n.d.). Examples of SDOH include the following:
Safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods
Racism, discrimination, and violence
Education, job opportunities, and income
Access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities
Polluted air and water
Language and literacy skills
One of the goals of Healthy People 2030 is to address SDOH and create social, physical, and economic conditions that promote health and well-being for all.

Food Insecurity
Food insecurity is access to nutritious foods that is limited or uncertain because of social or economic factors (National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities [NIMHHD], n.d.). Clients with food insecurity do not have consistent, reliable sources of nutrient-dense foods. Poverty, long-term health conditions, and racial discrimination are some of the factors that can lead to food insecurity (Feeding America, 2023). In 2020, almost 15 percent of U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in time (NIMHHD, n.d.). Nurses should screen clients for food insecurity as part of a nutritional assessment.
Food Insecurity
As part of a nutrition assessment, clients should be screened for food insecurity. The USDA has a Household Food Security Survey (HFSS) that can be used. However, researchers have developed a brief two-question tool based upon the HFSS that can be used to quickly screen clients. The Hunger Vital Sign includes two statements that can be read during a client interview; the client should respond to each statement as “often true,” “sometimes true,” or “never true” for their household in the last 12 months. If the client responds “often true” or “sometimes true” to either question, the screening for food insecurity is positive.
“We worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.”
“The food we bought just didn’t last, and we didn’t have money to get more.”
The Hunger Vital Sign screening is easy to use and is increasingly being built into electronic health record systems (Gattu et al., 2019).
Impact on Health and Food Choices
Local environments influence food insecurity significantly (NIMHHD, n.d.). For example, food deserts are geographic areas that lack access to affordable, healthy food. These can be rural or urban areas that lack grocery stores with healthy food options. In some areas, there may be stores that sell food, but the food is not nutritious. Food swamps are areas with stores that sell food, but the food is high in calories, sugar, sodium, and/or fat—often referred to as junk food.
When people do not have reliable, nutritious food sources, they cannot follow recommended diets. As such, food insecurity is associated with poor health outcomes. People with food insecurity are at increased risk for long-term health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, and heart disease (NIMHHD, n.d.).
Promoting Food Security
Food security means having enough food for an active, healthy life (NIMHHD, n.d.). Promoting food security necessitates educating and referring clients to additional resources (Hunger + Health, 2023). Food literacy—understanding labels and making good food choices—is critical to improving food security (Devine & Lawlis, 2019). Sometimes the client can access adequate quantities of food, but it is not quality, nutrient-dense food. For example, the client may eat a lot of fast food or junk food from a convenience store. Although education is essential to improving the client’s diet, education alone is not enough. The client needs access to the types of foods recommended through client teaching. Nurse referrals to community agencies for food and other financial assistance are essential.

Nurse referrals to community agencies for food and other financial assistance are essential.

Vulnerable Populations
Some groups in the U.S. are considered vulnerable populations because nonmedical factors limit their ability to achieve health and wellness (CDC, 2022b). Examples of vulnerable populations include racial or ethnic minority groups, low-income groups, migrants, the elderly, and children. When assessing clients, nurses should consider whether they are part of a vulnerable population and plan interventions accordingly.
The County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) (2023) provide data to raise awareness of factors that influence health in a community. This information is available for anyone to access. Nurses can use this information to learn more about the clients they treat. Communities can use the information obtained from these rankings to promote health equity and improve the overall health of their citizens. The CHR&R model identifies SDOH and how they relate to citizens’ health factors. Communities can develop policies and programs to influence these health factors that influence health outcomes.
Connect Health Literacy and Health Equity
Teaching nutrition using resources and strategies that address health literacy needs also promotes health equity. Teach clients in a way that matches their cultural, language, and environmental needs, so they are more likely to understand and accept what is being taught (USHHS, 2021). Health literacy can make information easier to understand and health equity can make the information more inclusive.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Apply EBP to client nutrition education and care.
Use EBP to evaluate trending nutritional views.
Use EBP to evaluate trending social media influencers.

Applying Evidence-Based Practice
Health information is readily available via the Internet. Unfortunately, only some of this information is vetted for appropriateness and validity. Nurses should steer clients toward reliable sources of evidence-based information.
EBP is fundamental to nursing practice—whether collaborating with an interdisciplinary team or working individually with clients directly. Throughout the remainder of this educational resource, the nurse will have opportunities to apply EBP to various nutritionally based client scenarios. Working through these scenarios, via unfolding and static client case studies, will require the nurse to apply concepts of clinical judgment (introduced from the NCJMM) to foster health and well-being to clients across all body systems and the lifespan. Unfolding case studies will build on prior knowledge and scenarios, although static case studies will relate to a single client in a specific situation. When using EBP to navigate the case studies, an understanding of nutrition and body system disorders will be used to develop the best plan of care for the client.
Diversity Implications
Research on nutrition has traditionally focused on biological relationships between diet and health. Although this is important, researchers must consider other factors. SDOH, health disparities, and health inequities all affect clients’ nutritional intake and need to be addressed in research. Doing this will help researchers shift their nutritional recommendations from a “one size fits all approach” to evidence-based recommendations that can be utilized by diverse populations (Mattes et al, 2022).

Evaluating Trending Nutritional Views
As mentioned earlier, an overwhelming amount of information is available to the consumer through the Internet. Consumers use the Internet to search health-related issues, find health care providers, and explore available resources. New (and sometimes not so new) nutrition trends are always appearing.  lists some of the more prevalent trends in recent years. Encourage clients to use the approaches previously described in the Consumer Health Information section to review and discuss with their health care provider any trends that they are considering trying.

Nutritional Trends from 2000 to the Present

Evaluating Social Media Sources for Nutrition Information
Over four billion social media users view information on social media sites. Social media can provide 24/7 support from other users or support groups, instant communication, and cost-effective health care options. Use of social media and other Internet sites also pose security risks, provide false information, promote inappropriate sharing of research findings, and promote self-diagnosis without the benefit of an assessment from a trained, experienced health care provider. A recent study of nutritional information on Instagram found the quality of the content to be extremely low (Kabata et al, 2022). When looking at social media posts, consumers should consider the following things (Johns Hopkins Sheridan Libraries, 2023):
The poster—Is this person qualified to post on this topic?
Network—Do other credible people or organizations follow this account?
Content—Can the information be corroborated from other sources?
Contextual updates—Is this material they usually post about?
Age—Is this an established account, or recently created?
Reliability—Is the information source reliable?
As the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics noted, EBP uses scientific evidence rather than anecdotal evidence. This fundamental difference informs the nurse who evaluates trends in nutrition, especially those found on social media, and makes trusted recommendations to clients.
Benefits of Social Media Sources
Several sources channel the benefits of using social media to influence nutrition and nutritional education positively. Food Hero, an online nutrition resource provided by Oregon State University through funding from the USDA, provides an excellent format for social media sources to use. From the inclusion of several cultural resources to videos on demand and gardening tips, their site provides information in a dynamic format. Food Hero is found on Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest and serves as a great example for best practices on social media. Several other examples can be found by following the links in .

Pitfalls of Social Media Sources
As mentioned earlier, the Internet is full of conflicting information. The nurse should encourage clients to evaluate nutrition information on social media sites in the same way information from websites and the media is scrutinized. Much of the nutrition advice on social media is based on anecdotal findings and experiences rather than scientific inquiry. Non-scientific social media content can promote eating disorders, distorted views of body image, and an unrealistic promotion of diet culture, all of which negatively impact nutrition and wellness.
Nutrition is the intake of food to meet the body’s needs. Analyzing the quantity of food intake is not sufficient; the food consumed must be nutritional.
Several noninvasive body measurements are needed for a nutritional assessment – weight, BMI, and WHR.
Nutrition is vital to health promotion, and nutrition plays a prominent role in Healthy People 2030.
The nurse is but one member of the interdisciplinary team caring for the client. The team must work together to manage the client’s nutrition.
Based on the nursing process, the NCJMM incorporates clinical judgment to make decisions required in current nursing practice.
The USDA and the FDA are the federal agencies that oversee food production, labeling, and consumption. Nonprofit organizations also play an essential role in promoting nutrition.
Education is an integral part of nutrition-related interventions for clients. The client must be ready to learn, and the nurse must use an individualized approach to teaching. Evaluate the effectiveness of client education by receiving feedback from the client and tracking health outcomes.
SDOH are nonmedical factors that affect individuals’ health and contribute to food insecurity. The nurse can address food insecurity through client education and referrals to community resources.
Vulnerable populations are at risk for poor health. Community health needs assessments and community health rankings provide valuable information to address nonmedical factors influencing health.
EBP is essential to select interventions that can lead to good health outcomes.
Consumer nutrition information is abundant on the Internet, but not necessarily reliable or accurate.

Benefits of Social Media Sources
Several sources channel the benefits of using social media to influence nutrition and nutritional education positively. Food Hero, an online nutrition resource provided by Oregon State University through funding from the USDA, provides an excellent format for social media sources to use. From the inclusion of several cultural resources to videos on demand and gardening tips, their site provides information in a dynamic format. Food Hero is found on Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest and serves as a great example for best practices on social media. Several other examples can be found by following the links in .

Pitfalls of Social Media Sources
As mentioned earlier, the Internet is full of conflicting information. The nurse should encourage clients to evaluate nutrition information on social media sites in the same way information from websites and the media is scrutinized. Much of the nutrition advice on social media is based on anecdotal findings and experiences rather than scientific inquiry. Non-scientific social media content can promote eating disorders, distorted views of body image, and an unrealistic promotion of diet culture, all of which negatively impact nutrition and wellness.
Nutrition is the intake of food to meet the body’s needs. Analyzing the quantity of food intake is not sufficient; the food consumed must be nutritional.
Several noninvasive body measurements are needed for a nutritional assessment – weight, BMI, and WHR.
Nutrition is vital to health promotion, and nutrition plays a prominent role in Healthy People 2030.
The nurse is but one member of the interdisciplinary team caring for the client. The team must work together to manage the client’s nutrition.
Based on the nursing process, the NCJMM incorporates clinical judgment to make decisions required in current nursing practice.
The USDA and the FDA are the federal agencies that oversee food production, labeling, and consumption. Nonprofit organizations also play an essential role in promoting nutrition.
Education is an integral part of nutrition-related interventions for clients. The client must be ready to learn, and the nurse must use an individualized approach to teaching. Evaluate the effectiveness of client education by receiving feedback from the client and tracking health outcomes.
SDOH are nonmedical factors that affect individuals’ health and contribute to food insecurity. The nurse can address food insecurity through client education and referrals to community resources.
Vulnerable populations are at risk for poor health. Community health needs assessments and community health rankings provide valuable information to address nonmedical factors influencing health.
EBP is essential to select interventions that can lead to good health outcomes.
Consumer nutrition information is abundant on the Internet, but not necessarily reliable or accurate.

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the nutritional function of carbohydrates.
Identify the impact of carbohydrates on wellness promotion and illness prevention.

Carbohydrate Function and Metabolism
Carbohydrates are a large food category containing starches, cellulose, and sugars. They are composed of organic carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen molecules and are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, and dairy products. The term carbohydrate refers to both simple and complex carbohydrates.
Converting carbohydrates found in food to cellular energy begins with enzyme action in the mouth and is completed by enzymes formed in the small intestine and auxiliary organs.  lists some enzymes and their breakdown products. The end product of carbohydrate metabolism is a simple sugar; the three main ones involved in human nutrition are glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose, a simple sugar, provides energy to cells and is the preferred fuel for the brain and nervous system. It is a monosaccharide, which is a sugar molecule that cannot be further metabolized.

Some Enzymes and Their Breakdown Products
Monosaccharides link with each other in different formations to create disaccharides, compounds made up of two monosaccharide molecules. The disaccharide sucrose is formed from one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule; lactose is formed from glucose and galactose, and maltose is formed from two glucose molecules. Disaccharides are present in a wide variety of foods: lactose in milk products, maltose in molasses and other fermented foods, and sucrose in a wide variety of foods as table sugar. Once a disaccharide is broken into monosaccharides, a rise in blood sugar can be seen in 10–15 min. These rapid spikes in blood sugar can be dangerous for individuals with diabetes.

Complex Carbohydrates and Fiber
Complex carbohydrates, also called polysaccharides, comprise long chains of glucose molecules, creating starch or fiber. The chains of glucose molecules in starch are digestible and are slowly metabolized to a monosaccharide. Fiber is made up of plant substances, such as cellulose, and moves through the digestive system in an undigested form. Fiber is best known for its gastrointestinal health benefits. Research shows that fiber protects against colorectal cancer, diabetes, diverticulitis, heart disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and obesity (Precker, 2022; USDA, 2022). Although the recommended fiber amount varies with age and sex, an estimated 95% of American adults and children do not consume recommended amounts of fiber (Quagliani & Felt-Gunderson, 2016) . The most prudent advice on increasing dietary fiber is to increase high-fiber foods gradually to avoid cramping, gas, and bloating, while ensuring adequate fluid intake.  lists some common foods and their fiber content.

Common Foods and the Amount of Fiber in Standard Portion Sizes (source: USDA, 2022)
Ultraprocessed Foods
Food not eaten in its original state is considered processed. Processed food can include something as minimally processed as wheat milled into flour or as complex as a hot dog made from five or more ingredients. It is estimated that ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), commercially produced food products with a long shelf life and usually high in sodium and fat, provide 50–60% of individuals’ total daily energy consumption in some high-income countries (Beslay et al., 2020). During ultraprocessing of grains, they are refined, thereby losing essential nutrients, and sugar and salt are added. Therefore, UPFs are much more likely to have lower amounts of fiber and higher amounts of sugar and salt than their unrefined versions, as well as chemical preservatives, such as nitrates and sulfides, to extend shelf life.  includes examples of how whole foods, or foods in their natural state, are transitioned into UPFs. Research studies on UPF and type 2 diabetes have found that participants with the highest UPF consumption had a higher risk for type 2 diabetes, with a statistically significant dose–response relationship (Llavero-Valero et al., 2021; Seal et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2023).

Some Whole Foods and Their Transition to Ultraprocessed Foods
Nurses can help increase food literacy by holding meaningful discussions with clients about where food comes from and how it is changed as it enters the consumer marketplace. Clients should be able to identify UPFs and understand their relationship to health issues such as obesity, hypertension, and cancer (Fiolet et al., 2018). Creating meal plans with whole and minimally processed foods ensures the consumption of more complex carbohydrates instead of simple sugars.

Creating meal plans with whole and minimally processed foods ensures the consumption of more complex carbohydrates instead of simple sugars.

Carbohydrates and Nutrition-Related Disease
When discussing carbohydrate-related diseases with clients, the nurse should always consider the type of carbohydrate and the amount of sugar, fat, and salt added to carbohydrate-rich foods during processing. Carbohydrates should make up 50–65% of caloric intake. However, there is a significant difference in health impact if 50% of carbohydrates come from sugar-sweetened beverages and salty snacks instead of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Individuals with a plant-forward philosophy typically consume less meat and more fresh and minimally processed grains, fruits, and vegetables. A plant-forward meal plan provides more fiber, less sodium, and, consequently, lower spikes in blood glucose. Research suggests that carbohydrates found in whole foods, especially fiber, promotes health by contributing to good gut microbiota (Clemente-Suarez, 2022). e, Overconsumption of any macronutrient can contribute to weight gain. A regular diet of ultraprocessed carbohydrates has been associated with overweight, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes (Wood et al., 2023).
Two diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats are the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH). The Mediterranean diet is an excellent example of a diet high in complex carbohydrates because it is rich in fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The diet also includes fish, seafood, and poultry, as well as dairy products in moderate amounts. This diet is high in omega-3 fatty acids (from fish) and low in fat. The Mediterranean diet can be beneficial because it reduces heart disease, improves serum lipid profiles, and decreases hypertension (Hauser et al., 2022).
Research has shown that the DASH diet can substantially lower blood pressure (Hauser et al., 2022). The DASH diet includes minimally processed foods, and sugary beverages, sweets, and red and processed meats are discouraged. Other research has found that rates of diabetes, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and obesity are lower in individuals following diets like the Mediterranean and DASH diets (Shoaibinobarian et al., 2023).
Many chapters within this textbook discuss the DASH and Mediterranean diets. Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Mayo Clinic both provide easy-to-read information on these two meal plans. When working with clients, nurses should remember that meal plans may need to be customized for individuals from various cultures and socioeconomic groups.

Carbohydrates and Athletes
Athletes need increased molecular energy in the form of carbohydrates to sustain their energy supply during exercise. When someone is exercising, circulating glucose is the first source of energy. This energy source is quickly depleted, and the body then relies on stored glycogen, a large polysaccharide stored in limited amounts in the skeletal muscle and liver. When these stores are depleted, the body metabolizes fat for additional energy. Fat releases energy slower than carbohydrates do and requires over twice as much oxygen to complete the breakdown. Recent research indicates that manipulating fat intake before an athletic event may further increase endurance (Iwayama et al., 2023). Endurance athletes have practiced “carbohydrate loading” since the 1960s, which means they deliberately maximize the amount of carbohydrate in their diet approximately three days before a competition (Thomas et al., 2016), thereby enlarging their glycogen stores. diet higher in carbohydrates than usual, coupled with days of no exercise, allows for the maximum buildup of stored energy.

Milk Carbohydrate and Lactose Intolerance
People are often surprised to discover that dairy products contain sugar. Lactose, often called “milk sugar,” is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose. Breaking down lactose into a monosaccharide requires the enzyme lactase. Lactase peaks at birth so that infants can digest breast milk. If lactose intolerance is diagnosed, it is not recommended to change to a completely dairy-free diet, as many intolerant patients can tolerate up to 12–15 g of lactose per day without side effects (Catanzaro et al., 2021). Some people do not have this enzyme due to injury or a defect in the small intestine. Lactose intolerance appears to occur more frequently in Africa and Asia, while northern Europeans show better tolerance of lactose-containing foods. In the U.S it is estimated that about 33% of the population has lactose intolerance (Alzahrani et al., 2022).
Without lactase, individuals will develop lactose intolerance symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. They can take steps to help minimize discomfort and still consume milk-based foods by consuming lactose-free dairy products or taking lactase enzymes before meals to aid digestion. Additional calcium and vitamin D sources should be pursued if clients limit their dairy intake. A possible replacement for these nutrients is plant-based dairy products such as calcium- and vitamin D-fortified almond, rice, soy, hemp, and coconut milk if food allergies are not a concern (Katoch et al., 2022).

Carbohydrates and Blood Glucose
For individuals attempting to stabilize their blood sugar, intentional monitoring of food intake is critical, as sugars, starches, and fiber can affect blood glucose levels. Monosaccharides can cause spikes in blood glucose, requiring the hormone insulin to move it into the cells. Starch and fiber cause a less dramatic rise in blood glucose. For healthy adults, whole or minimally processed carbohydrates should supply 50–65% of daily calories. The American Diabetic Association recommends that the percentage of daily carbohydrates be individualized for those with diabetes. Current recommendations include a focus on self-management of diabetes, including individualization of carbohydrate levels based on food preferences and metabolic goals (American Diabetic Association, 2019).
The glycemic index is a tool for better understanding the impact of certain foods on blood sugar. More than 4,000 foods have been ranked based on the availability of highly absorbable monosaccharides (Atkinson et al., 2021). For example, processed foods made with refined flour and sugar, including cookies, cakes, and candy, have a high glycemic index, whereas whole foods, such as unrefined grains and nonstarchy vegetables, have a lower glycemic index. It is important to note that the glycemic index evaluates only individual foods, not entire meals, and no nutrient qualities are included in the glycemic index rankings (Charles, 2022).
The glycemic load is a newer and more comprehensive approach for assessing the impact of carbohydrates on blood glucose. The glycemic load uses the glycemic index and the number of total carbohydrates in a food serving to predict the timing and rise of blood glucose. It is a more accurate assessment of healthy food intake than the glycemic index alone (Charles, 2022).

Nurses should be aware of the symptoms of lactose intolerance, which include bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence. They should also be knowledgeable about the lactose content of various foods and be able to suggest alternatives to dairy products for those who are lactose intolerant. In conclusion, understanding the nutritional function of carbohydrates and their impact on wellness and illness prevention is essential for nurses in providing holistic care to their clients. By being knowledgeable about carbohydrate function and metabolism, complex carbohydrates and fiber, ultraprocessed foods, carbohydrate-related diseases, and the role of carbohydrates in athletic performance and lactose intolerance, nurses can effectively educate and support their clients in making informed dietary choices for optimal health.","the population has lactose intolerance (aan et al., 202). uses ldeeop lactose intolerance ch  bloating, diarrhea an atlec  sould s b noeee aout t lactse otent  vaious ods nd e ble to se tentis t dairy products for oe o e actose ntoerat. n oluso ndestai the uritional ntin of odrates and er act o ellnes an illne reventon is essental or nrses  podi oistic care t their liets.  ein nldeale abut carbohydrate fnc and metabolism, cmex arbdrates and fiber, raprocessed foods ahreelad disaes, and he role o cardras n athleti porance nd latos nteran nurse cn eeciely dae and sppor their clients in aing ored dietar cces fo tial hal.",25.0501002004008,"the population has lactose intolerance et al., symptoms bloating, and They foods and be dairy products are the of carbohydrates and impact on and is in and carbohydrates and the of carbohydrates in and",9.090909090909092, lactose intolerance (,0.8021390374331552

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the nutritional function of fats.
Identify the impact of fats on wellness promotion and illness prevention.
Examine special considerations for individuals who face challenges securing adequate fat intake.

Fat Function and Metabolism
Fats are found primarily in animal foods such as meat, high-fat dairy products, and fried food, although plants are also sources of fat in the form of oils. Fat is a concentrated energy source, supplying more than double the caloric energy of carbohydrates or protein. See  for the comparison of energy in macronutrients. (Note that alcohol also provides calories, but unlike the macronutrients, it does not provide vitamins, minerals, or fiber. Its calories are therefore commonly referred to as “empty” because they have no nutritional value.)
Fat helps maintain body temperature, is a critical part of fat-soluble vitamin transport, protects body organs by cushioning them, and is an essential component of cell membranes. Hormones secreted by accessory organs assist in fat metabolism. Although an enzyme, lingual lipase, exists in the mouth, the bulk of fat digestion occurs in the small intestine, where ingested triglycerides—fats composed of three fatty acids and one glycerol molecule—break down into monoglycerides and glycerol.

Energy Contribution of Carbohydrates, Fat, Proteins, Water, and Alcohol
Fat adds a smooth taste to foods and contributes to satiety. For instance, fat contributes to the flavor of a well-marbled steak, a loaded baked potato, chicken cooked with skin, cereal with whole milk, coffee with cream, and deep-fried fish with french fries. These foods are high in calories and saturated fat and may take twice as long to digest as carbohydrates, remaining in the stomach and intestine longer and staving off hunger pains. During fat digestion, the intestinal cells secrete the hormone cholecystokinin, which slows pancreatic function and causes longer gastric emptying, making the person feel full (Borer, 2023).
The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are found only in fat-containing foods. They travel through the blood with fat molecules from the small intestine and are stored in the liver until needed. Because the fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body, there is no need for daily ingestion. The storage mechanism makes deficiencies rare in the United States, except for vitamin D deficiency, which has seen a large uptick globally over the last decade. According to Guilbeau and Watson (2022), an estimated 18% of people in the U.S. has inadequate levels of vitamin D and 5% have vitamin D deficiency. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies may occur when fat is restricted or when a client receives total parental nutrition without lipids.
According to the U.S. dietary guidelines for Americans for 2020–2025, no more than 20–35% of daily calories should come from fat; the exception is toddlers aged two to three years, for whom the goal is 30–40% (U.S. Department of Agriculture & U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Fat is an essential nutrient critical for metabolic functions including vitamin synthesis, long-term energy storage, and the production of essential fatty acids. However, given its caloric density, too much fat, like too much carbohydrate or protein, can raise caloric intake above caloric output, causing weight gain.
Saturated Fat
A saturated fat is usually solid at room temperature and is found in animal-based foods and some plant oils. Saturated fat was first linked with heart disease in the 1950s by Ancel Keys, who proposed the diet–heart hypothesis (Teicholz, 2023). It has been widely accepted that a decrease in saturated fat is protective against the development of cardiovascular disease (MacDonald et al., 2022). The U.S. dietary guidelines for 2020–2025 continue to include the recommendation to lower the intake of saturated fat. The American Heart Association recommends a dietary pattern that achieves 5–6% of calories from saturated fat. For example, if an individual needs about 2,000 calories a day, 120 calories at most should come from saturated fat, or approximately 13 g per day (American Heart Association, 2021).  lists amounts of saturated fat in some everyday foods.

Various Oils and Their Monounsaturated Fat Content (source: Gebhardt & Thomas, 2022; USDA, 2019)
There is a difference between animal monounsaturated and plant monounsaturated fats. Animal-based mono-unsaturated fats are present in eggs, poultry, red meat, fish, and full-fat dairy. Evidence demonstrates that research subjects who had “a higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids from animals had a 21% higher risk of death from any cause” (American Heart Association, 2018). A decrease in mortality was observed when monounsaturated fats such as olive oil were substituted for saturated fats (Guasch-Ferre et al., 2019).
Polyunsaturated Fats
Two well-known polyunsaturated fats are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats play a role in heart health and are found in eggs, soybeans, flaxseed, canola oil, and fatty fish such as salmon. The role of omega-6 fatty acid in heart health is more complex than that of omega-3. Its greatest effect appears to be strengthening of the immune system. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in sunflower, safflower, soy, sesame, and corn oils.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are known for their health properties and anti-inflammatory action (Currenti et al., 2022). Polyunsaturated fats should make up no more than about 11% of the 20–35% of daily calories from fat (Liu et al., 2016).  presents a comparison of the polyunsaturated content of common cooking oils.
The majority of daily fat consumption should come from unsaturated sources, i.e., monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (Schweichler, 2022).

Trans Fats
Artificially produced trans fats have been used as food stabilizers in baked goods, snacks, and fried fast foods for more than 100 years (Amico et al, 2021). Trans fats make potato chips crisp and margarine spreadable, and they add texture to peanut butter. Trans fats also appear on food labels as partially hydrogenated oils, which are created when food manufacturers take unsaturated oils and mechanically add hydrogen ions, thereby making the liquid oil more saturated and partially firm.
Decades of research associating trans fats with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a significant cholesterol-carrying molecule in the blood, and lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a protein/lipid molecule that removes cholesterol from the blood, coupled with much grassroots advocacy, resulted in mandated food labeling of trans fat in 2006. Yet, it took more than 25 years to enact a ban on artificial trans fats in food products from the time they were first noted to be harmful. (Amico et al., 2021). Small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats are found in meat and dairy products. However, they do not appear to have the same negative impact as artificial trans fats and are not harmful if consumed in moderation (Bendsen et al., 2011).

However, they do not appear to have the same negative impact as artificial trans fats and are not harmful if consumed in moderation (Bendsen et al., 2011).

Cooking and Food Preparation Techniques
Fat adds flavor to food, but most Americans consume more daily fat than recommended for heart health. Fat is an essential nutrient, and in a varied meal plan of whole grains, lean meats, and fresh fruits and vegetables, excessive dietary fat is not usually an issue. However, cooking techniques can take the healthiest of foods and add unneeded fat. A common example of a cooking technique that adds fat is deep frying, which can increase a food’s caloric content by 50% or more. Vegetables are low in fat, but when breaded and fried, the caloric and fat content climb, significantly reducing the health benefits. For example, battering and frying mushrooms, onion rings, and cauliflower change the nutrition profile by adding a significant amount of fat to a food group with negligible fat.
Alternatives to deep frying have emerged with the widespread marketing of countertop air fryers. This innovative cooking tool “fries” food with hot air and can save 70–80% of calories (Watson, 2021). Other more conventional ways to eliminate fat include grilling, baking, roasting, or boiling food items and adding flavor with seasonings or with low-fat rather than full-fat sauces. In baking, a 50% reduction of fat can be accomplished by substituting applesauce, canned pumpkin, pureed prunes, or mashed bananas for butter. (Using low-fat margarine in baking is not recommended because these products have added water and will affect the texture of the baked item.) Fat in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids can be added by sauteing vegetables in olive oil or by adding avocado or minimally processed peanut butter to toast.
Food preparation techniques, such as adding heavy dressing to a green salad, can also alter a food’s nutrition profile. Loading a baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese, and bacon can increase its calories dramatically. Eating simple foods without high-fat enhancements is a real starting point for better health.

Special Considerations for Individuals Who Face Challenges Securing Adequate Fat Intake
Fat intake is a challenge for many people who consume a Western diet. However, the challenge is not securing adequate fat but controlling the overconsumption of fat. For more than 100 years, scientists and researchers have believed that fat plays a role in heart disease. Researchers are widely convinced that saturated fat increases LDL cholesterol and is a significant causal factor in the development of heart disease (Kris-Etherton & Krauss, 2020).
The lack of enzymes or emulsifying agents (i.e., bile) that help digest fat impacts dietary guidance on fat intake. Clients who have their gallbladder removed are encouraged to avoid high-fat, fried, and greasy foods, such as fatty sauces and gravies (Rajan, 2021), for at least a week after surgery.
Today, a “food replacement message” is this: Replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, or monounsaturated fat, and trading ultra-processed foods for a diet rich in whole, minimally processed foods may lower heart disease. This food replacement message resonates with the U.S. dietary guidelines and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate food guide and should be at the core of food literacy.

Healthier cooking methods include grilling, baking, steaming, and sautéing with minimal oil. When using oils for cooking, it's important to choose heart-healthy options such as olive oil, canola oil, or avocado oil, which are high in monounsaturated fats and low in saturated fats. Additionally, incorporating more plant-based fats, such as nuts, seeds, and avocados, into the diet can provide essential fatty acids and contribute to overall heart health.

Describe the nutritional function of proteins.
Identify the impact of proteins on wellness promotion and illness prevention.
Examine special considerations for individuals who face challenges securing adequate protein intake.

Nutritional Function of Proteins
Proteins are found in every cell and perform various functions in the human body. The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach with the enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid. The acidic environment denatures the proteins, and the enzyme divides the protein into smaller polypeptides, which are linear organic molecules consisting of many amino acid residues bonded together in a chain, forming part or all of a protein. The small intestine also releases digestive hormones, including secretin and cholecystokinin, which stimulate the enzymes to break down the proteins into individual amino acids. Accessory organs release additional enzymes and contribute to the breaking of complex proteins into smaller individual amino acids, which are transported across the intestinal mucosa.
In the final stages of metabolism, amino acids remain in the amino acid pool, a total number of essential amino acids and nonessential amino acids available for building proteins, which is regulated by the liver. Circulating amino acids recombine to form every protein required for maintenance and growth. In contrast, excess protein is converted to glucose or triglycerides depending on the body’s need for energy. The sequence of the amino acids and folding of the protein molecule determines the function .
The structure of a protein determines its function. (credit: modification of work from Biology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Amino acids are classified as essential if they come from food and nonessential if the body can synthesize them. See  for a list of amino acids and their classification. Amino acids are continually needed to replace normal cell breakdown. Each protein has a specific sequencing of amino acids; when one is missing, protein synthesis stops until the muscle breaks down to free up the needed amino acids for the amino acid pool. The intricate folding of the protein molecule is based on the function required. For example, the proteins in nails, when compared to those in the eyes, are very different in structure because the functions are highly diverse.

Protein Intake for Wellness Promotion and Illness Prevention
Protein is essential for all tissues, and regular protein intake is essential to prevent proteolysis, a breakdown of proteins that causes loss of lean muscle mass. Because protein is essential for all tissues, it is a superstar of dietary intake. However, protein myths have elevated this macronutrient to an extreme level. High-protein diets, protein powder, and amino acid supplements are popular as individuals pursue well-muscled bodies. Most adults require only 1–1.2 g of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. For example, a person who weighs 165 pounds (75 kg), should consume 75–90 g of protein daily. Protein is not stockpiled in the body. Therefore, a diet high in protein will not make for larger muscles or longer hair and nails, but an excessive amount of protein can contribute to weight gain. Unneeded protein is stripped of its amino group, the nitrogen is excreted in the urine, and the carbon remnant is converted to either glucose or triglyceride for use as energy.
Proteins from animal sources provide the highest quality proteins or “complete proteins” because they contain all the essential amino acids. Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs are complete proteins. However, individuals following a plant-based diet can achieve complete proteins by eating various legumes, grains, and nuts. Interestingly, soy is the only legume classed as “complete” because it contains all the essential amino acids (Metropulos, 2019). However, it is less digestible than animal protein, as humans cannot digest cellulose in the plant cell structure.
All animal proteins contain cholesterol, so a high-protein diet of beef, pork, poultry, and eggs will also be higher in fat and cholesterol. Lean meats cooked without added fat, poultry without skin, and egg whites instead of whole eggs will help control fat and cholesterol and provide adequate, high-quality protein.
Protein supplements are unnecessary if an individual is in good health, moderately active, and knowledgeable about nutrition. A well-balanced diet with lean proteins and necessary fat, carbohydrate, and micronutrients can provide adequate nutrients without purchased supplements. The bioavailability, the way food is absorbed, of the macronutrients and micronutrients is better for whole foods. For example, chocolate milk is a “close to perfect” postexercise supplement (Amiri et al., 2019). It contains the ideal ratio of carbohydrates to protein and includes the milk proteins casein and whey, which metabolize at different rates for replenishment in the short and long term (Garden-Robinson. & Christenson, 2019).
Nitrogen balance is widely used as an indicator to assess protein loss or gain. This indicator can be especially useful following trauma or prolonged illness (Dickerson, 2016). If dietary nitrogen intake in the form of protein is greater than what is lost, a positive nitrogen balance is achieved, reflecting a gain of total body protein. Positive nitrogen balance is essential for growth and healing.
Conversely, a negative nitrogen balance reflects protein degradation, with protein loss higher than protein retention. A negative protein balance in acute care substantially impacts survival (Dupuis et al., 2022). Healthy adults achieve nitrogen balance when protein intake is the same as protein degradation.  lists the protein content of animal and plant-based foods.

Special Considerations for Individuals Who Face Challenges Securing Adequate Protein Intake
Negative nitrogen balance occurs in several disease states, ranging from poor protein intake, which can be related to eating disorders or bariatric surgery, to hypermetabolic states requiring increased protein. Concurrently, carbohydrates and fats must meet energy needs to channel proteins specifically for tissue repair and restoration (Munoz & Posthauer, 2022). For example, more calories and protein are needed to repair and restore function during burn or wound healing, especially in children, in whom protein needs can be as high as 2.5–4.0 g/kg per day (Clark et al., 2017). Enteral nutrition within 24 hours of hospital admission is optimal, as oral meals cannot usually meet these metabolic requirements.
Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease has been traditionally treated with protein restriction, resulting in improved liver function. However, malnutrition has been noted in more than 50% of clients following a low-protein diet, contributing to low survival rates. Protein ingestion in liver disease must be individualized because although some clients with cirrhosis may tolerate normal protein intake, others may require targeted amino acid therapy to reduce the breakdown of lean muscle mass (Ampong et al., 2020).
Individuals with chronic renal disease also require protein in lower amounts. The kidneys eliminate protein waste products, so when an individual consumes less protein, the kidneys do not have to work as hard in filtering metabolites. The amount of prescribed protein in clients with chronic renal disease depends on their glomerular filtration rate (GFR). If the client progresses to dialysis, protein should be increased because of protein loss in the dialysate.  illustrates the decrease in recommended protein intake as the GFR decreases. When the GFR level drops below 15, the decision to begin dialysis depends on individual symptoms.

",6.0,"improved liver function. However, malnutrition has been noted in more than 50% of clients following a low-protein diet, contributing to low survival rates. Protein ingestion in liver disease must be individualized because although some clients with cirrhosis may tolerate normal protein intake, others may require targeted amino acid therapy to reduce the breakdown of lean muscle mass (Ampong et al., 2020). Individuals with chronic renal disease also require protein in lower amounts. The kidneys eliminate protein waste products, so when an individual consumes less protein, the kidneys do not have to work as hard in filtering metabolites. The amount of prescribed protein in clients with chronic renal disease depends on their glomerular filtration rate (GFR). If the client progresses to dialysis, protein should be increased because of protein loss in the dialysate. illustrates the decrease in recommended protein intake as the GFR decreases. When the GFR level drops below 15, the decision to begin dialysis depends on individual symptoms.

However, recent studies have shown that a balanced diet with adequate protein can improve muscle mass and strength, as well as reduce liver fat (Aragon et al., 2021). Protein needs are also increased in individuals with chronic kidney disease, as proteinuria and inflammation increase protein loss. However, protein intake must be balanced with the need to avoid overloading the kidneys with nitrogenous waste products (Kistler et al., 2018). In contrast, individuals with kidney disease who are on dialysis have increased protein needs to compensate for losses during dialysis. Protein needs are also increased in individuals with liver disease, as protein is essential for liver regeneration and function. However, protein intake must be balanced with the need to avoid hepatic encephalopathy, a condition in which the liver is unable to detoxify ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism (Amodio et al., 2014). In summary, protein is essential for all tissues and plays a crucial role in wellness promotion and illness prevention. However, individuals must be mindful of their protein intake, as excessive or inadequate consumption can have detrimental effects on health. It is important to consider individual needs and special considerations when planning a balanced and adequate protein intake.","mrod rcon.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the nutritional function of hydration.
Identify the impact of hydration on wellness promotion and illness prevention.
Examine special considerations for individuals who face challenges securing adequate hydration.

Hydration Function
Water is the universal solvent; every cell, tissue, and organ requires water to transport essential substances. Molecules dissolve into the watery blood environment and move through the body, providing cellular support. Blood also carries breakdown products for elimination. Staying hydrated is essential to good health and can be accomplished by responding to thirst and intentionally monitoring fluid intake. Older adults are at risk for dehydration because of diminished thirst and may cut back their fluid intake to avoid trips to the bathroom. Encouraging fluids can help mitigate poor fluid intake. See  for the use of urine concentration as an indicator of hydration status.
A color chart indicates the hydration level of urine. A very pale color indicates overhydration, whereas darker colors indicate underhydration. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Water has zero calories and is readily available. Plain water is best; tea, coffee, and sodas also provide fluids but often contain caffeine and sugar. How much water or other fluids are needed daily depends on body size, disease state, and activity level. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the recommended amount of water consumed per day is about 11.5 cups for women and 15.5 cups for men. This includes fluids consumed from both foods and beverages. Approximately 20% of this water comes from food consumption, which brings the fluid recommendations to about 9 cups per day for women and 13 cups per day for men (Gordon & Klemm, 2022).
Both food and fluids help an individual stay hydrated, enabling all body functions to perform optimally. Commercially bottled water is convenient, but given the problem with plastic waste, as well as the lack of fluoride in most bottled water, the use of refillable water bottles is an eco-friendly and bone-healthy alternative. The CDC (2020) reports that that bottled water may lack a sufficient amount of fluoride, which is important for oral health and preventing tooth decay.
Other highly advertised beverages include hydration drinks containing electrolytes, sugar, and caffeine. These drinks, sometimes referred to as sports drinks, may be helpful after intense exercise in adults but are not typically needed for children unless they are experiencing nausea and vomiting and require electrolyte replacement (Munoz-Urtuba et al., 2023). The more vigorous and longer the duration of the exercise, the more support research has provided for rehydration beverages containing both carbohydrates and electrolytes (McDermott et al., 2017).
Two simple ways the nurse can check for hydration status include tenting of the skin and the color of urine. The darker the urine, the greater the need for fluid .

Water Safety
Drinking water piped into homes may come from municipal water supplies or originate from a private well. Whereas municipal water supplies are monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, well water  is considered “private water,” and the safety is in the hands of the well owner (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023). Safe drinking water does not receive much attention until a public health emergency occurs. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes can introduce microorganisms or chemicals to municipal water supplies, making it unsafe. The county or state health departments issue notifications for unsafe water. Usually, boiling water can kill microorganisms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021); however, a water filter is needed to remove chemicals and heavy metals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022).
Healthy Water
Healthy water is usually taken for granted until sanitation or safety concerns make it a public health issue. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2022) provide education on a vast array of healthy water topics.

Carbohydrates, fats, protein, and water are essential for all body systems.
Helping clients manipulate proper energy intake while maintaining dietary recommendations and satisfying personal tastes requires a basic understanding of nutrition.
Carbohydrates provide easily metabolized sugars contributed by grains, legumes, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables.
Fats play many essential roles in the body, but because of their caloric density, they can contribute to obesity and cardiovascular disease.
Protein is critical to cell development; complete proteins (providing all of the essential amino acids) are regularly needed. Protein can contribute to a diet higher in fat.
Water guidelines cover normal fluid losses but may need to be altered for certain conditions.

Vitamin Function
The human body obtains vitamins—nutrients the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy—in two ways: food and supplementation. Vitamins were first referred to as “accessory factors” that were present in food in small amounts but essential for health. It was not until the start of the 20th century that these factors were named vitamins and, at the beginning of the 21st century, became a multibillion-dollar industry, with over 50 percent of Americans saying they regularly take vitamins of some variety. (Mishra et al., 2021)
Vitamins are separated into two classes: fat-soluble and water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are absorbed along with fats in the diet and are stored in the body’s fatty tissue and liver. These vitamins play critical roles in vision, bone health, immune function, and coagulation. Water-soluble vitamins (all other vitamins besides A, D, E, and K) are dissolved in water. Excess intake of water-soluble vitamins is excreted in the urine.
All vitamins are found naturally in foods and have specific functions. In general, vitamins play the following essential roles (Fletcher, 2019):
Boost the immune system
Decrease the risk for certain cancers
Strengthen teeth and bones
Maintain healthy skin
Help the body metabolize proteins and carbohydrates
Support healthy blood
Aid brain and nervous system functions
Vitamins A, D, E, and K
Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Fat-soluble vitamins play essential roles in many physiological processes, such as vision, bone health, immune function, and blood clotting (Reddy & Jialal, 2022). Fat-soluble vitamins, like dietary fat, are absorbed through the lymphatic system and then released into the blood, carried by transport proteins. Because these vitamins are stored, daily intake is not required. Excess intake of fat-soluble vitamins, as found with some supplements, can cause toxicity—side effects from taking large doses of supplements or medications.
Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins occurs in the small intestine where they are mixed with bile salts, fatty acids, and phospholipids; absorbed by chylomicrons (microproteins); and, carried to the lymphatic system. Since all vitamins require carrier proteins for transportation across the lipid bi-layer, absorption can be affected adversely by a genetic abnormality in the transport molecules (Ofoedu et al., 2021).
Vitamin A is active in the genetic development of retinol pigments and contributes to healthy bones, teeth, and soft tissue. Vitamin A also plays a role in reproduction, facilitating semen production and cell differentiation in fetal development. Vitamin A is critical in immune function, helping to grow the cells that produce the mucus that lines the gastrointestinal tracts, sinuses, and genitourinary tract. This mucus traps and protects the human body from the myriad bacteria it encounters daily. Beta-carotene—a precursor to vitamin A—is an antioxidant that protects against certain cancers and aging by stabilizing free radicals; a free radical is an unstable molecule made during normal cell metabolism that has one unpaired electron ().

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that closely resembles a hormone’s functions. This vitamin can trigger effects in tissue throughout the body, turning on and off the production of proteins. Vitamin D, like vitamin A, plays a role in immunity by promoting the secretion of infection-fighting substances found in white blood cells (Dimitrov et al., 2021).
Vitamin D naturally occurs in some foods (fatty fish and egg yolks), is added to others (like milk and orange juice) and is available as a vitamin supplement. Vitamin D is unusual because the body can synthesize it from a cholesterol precursor—7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)—in the epidermis with the help of ultraviolet light. In addition, vitamin D assists in promoting calcium uptake in the gut and ensures adequate calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Bones can become thin, fragile, and deformed without sufficient vitamin D. Vitamin D prevents rickets, the softening of the bones, which results in bowed legs, and protects against osteoporosis, the loss of bone density, which leads to porous structure (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2023e).
Vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin, acts as an antioxidant and stops the development of free radicals during fat oxidation. Fat oxidation is a chemical reaction in which a healthy molecule loses or is robbed of one of its electrons, which then produces an unhealthy free radical. In addition to protecting the cell from reactive oxygen species (ROS) (reactive species capable of causing damage to biomolecules), vitamin E helps establish a robust immune system and improves the endothelial cells on the surface of blood vessels, making them more resistant to the adherence of clots (NIH, 2021c).
Many other claims about vitamin E exist; however, due to the difficulty in establishing biomarkers and correlating them with clinical outcomes, recommendations for vitamin E intake continues to emerge (Institute of Medicine [U.S.] Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, 2000). Recently, the Food and Nutrition Board suggested that vitamin E intake among healthy adults is probably higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) but warns that those following a low-fat diet could experience a deficiency (NIH, 2021c).
Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is a coenzyme required for blood clotting and bone metabolism. Vitamin K is present in the liver and other body tissues, including the brain, heart, pancreas, and bone. Compared with other fat-soluble vitamins, minimal amounts of vitamin K circulate in the blood due to rapid metabolism and excretion (NIH, 2021d). The clinical status of vitamin K should be regularly evaluated in individuals who take anticoagulants or have bleeding disorders. Infants are injected with vitamin K at birth to decrease the risk of a hemorrhagic event (Hand et al., 2022).
Because fat-soluble vitamins are stored in tissue, higher amounts of these vitamins result in toxicity. In some water-soluble vitamins, high-potency supplementation can also result in adverse health issues ().

B Vitamins
This section outlines water-soluble vitamins, which includes the family of B vitamins and vitamin C. There are eight B vitamins (at times referred to as B complex): thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12).
All B vitamins act as coenzymes for catalytic activity and several processes that support every aspect of cellular function, including brain and nervous system functions (Hanna et al., 2022). Although almost all the B vitamins are involved in metabolism, one cannot be substituted for another. Therefore, a specific B vitamin deficiency is associated with a specific disease. In general, deficiency diseases related to B vitamins are rare, partly because of the wide availability of these vitamins in everyday food items, but also because B vitamins that are commonly lost in food processing are added back into the food. For example, when the bran and germ are removed from grains, leaving only the endosperm, B vitamins and vitamin E are also removed (). Food manufacturers add back the vitamins during food processing. This process is called food enrichment and is subject to government oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Institute of Medicine [U.S.] Committee on Use of Dietary Reference Intakes in Nutrition Labeling [IOM], 2003; Newman et al., 2020).

Energy Production from the Metabolism of Macronutrients with B Vitamin Catalysts
B vitamins must have macronutrients (carbohydrates, fat, and protein) available for energy production. Taking a vitamin supplement instead of a balanced meal does not provide a substrate for coenzyme action. Instead, obtaining vitamins through foods is preferred. Remember that none of the other B vitamins can cover a deficiency of another.
Choline, Biotin, and Folate
Other water-soluble substances that are less known include choline, biotin, and folate. Choline is an essential nutrient, not classified as a vitamin or a mineral, and is naturally present in food. Choline is often grouped with the B vitamins because it has similar functions. Vitamin research continues to improve classification, and in 2022 for the first time, a set amount, or Daily Value, for choline intake was included in the Daily Values (DVs), the list of all vitamins and minerals needed (FDA, 2022a). This nutrient is a source of methyl groups needed for many steps in lipid metabolism and is required to generate the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Although the body produces some choline endogenously in the liver, the amount is sometimes insufficient; additional choline must be ingested through food sources. Most people in the U.S. consume less than the recommended choline intake, yet a deficiency in healthy, nonpregnant individuals is rare, possibly because of the contribution of self-synthesized choline (NIH, 2022b).
Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that works as a cofactor that catalyzes the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids. Biotin is found in many animal and plant foods. There has never been a reported case of biotin deficiency in a healthy individual consuming a Western diet (NIH, 2022a).
Folate (B9 functions as a coenzyme in synthesizing ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Folate is also critical in the metabolism of amino acids required for normal cell division. A lack of folate will result in large red blood cells, which is associated with megaloblastic anemia—a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells. (NIH, 2022c). Large doses of folate can result in kidney damage.
The chemical structure of folate differs from the more commonly known folic acid. Folates are naturally found in foods, although folic acid is the fully oxidized form of the vitamin used in fortified foods and most dietary supplements. Since 1998, the FDA has mandated that food manufacturers add folic acid to “enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pasta, rice, and other grain products to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs)” (NIH, 2022c). NTDs result from a developmental error in the closure of the neural tube early in pregnancy and are one of the most common congenital disabilities in North America (National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). The fortification program is estimated to have increased mean folic acid intakes in the U.S. by about 200 mcg/day, a substantial increase. An unintentional consequence of folate fortification is that all people consuming the folate fortified foods receive extra folate, not just women of childbearing age. However, in the older adult, the consumption of folic acid from fortified foods increases the risk of ‘masking’ megaloblastic anemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency (van Gool et al., 2020).
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
Vitamin C or ascorbic acid, a water-soluble vitamin, is best known for its coenzyme and antioxidant properties (Abiri &Vafa, 2021). Vitamin C protects cells from premature aging caused by free radicals. Vitamin C stabilizes the cell by accepting or donating an electron. The body is constantly moving electrons around, so vitamin C is used in almost every tissue in the body. Free radicals are the leading cause of disease and inflammation, so vitamin C’s ability to neutralize those free radicals (acting as an antioxidant) is central to lowering heart disease and cancer risk.
Vitamin C also promotes collagen synthesis. Although collagen synthesis is required for maintaining normal vascular function, it also provides metabolic substrates for new blood vessel development (angiogenesis), enhancing blood supply, and bringing more oxygen to the tissues. Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system and increases the absorption of non-heme iron.
The body tightly monitors the plasma concentration of vitamin C. Approximately 70–90% of vitamin C is absorbed in moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. Absorption becomes less efficient at doses above 1,000 mg/day, with about 50% of the excess excreted in the urine (NIH, 2021b). Most healthy, non-smoking Americans consume enough vitamin C-rich foods to meet the daily requirements of 90 mg/day for males and 75 mg/day for females. According to national nutrition studies, the average vitamin C intake is about 95 mg/day without vitamin supplementation. See  for common fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C.

Vitamin C Levels in Common Foods (source: NIH, 2021a)
Large doses of vitamin C can have an adverse effect in people with a family history of kidney or gallstones. Supplementing vitamin C at a level three times or more of the RDA (approximately 3,000 mg) can double the amount of oxalate filtering through the kidney and greatly increases the chance of stone formation.
Absorption of water-soluble vitamins occurs in the small intestine through the process of diffusion or, in the case of riboflavin, by a carrier molecule and enters the bloodstream. Many water-soluble vitamins function as coenzymes in other cellular reactions and may require additional chemical action before tissues use them. Differences in ease of absorption or food bioavailability, dosage, and chemical form of the vitamin all influence the amount of the vitamin absorbed in the small intestine (Ofoedu et al., 2021).
Smoking and Increased Vitamin C Needs
Clients who smoke should increase their vitamin C by 35 mg/day. They have decreased plasma concentrations of this antioxidant due to an increase in free radicals. According to Lykkesfeldt and Tveden-Nyborg (2019), “Active smoking typically depletes the vitamin C pool by 25–50% compared to never-smokers.”
Certain populations or disease states require vitamin supplementation. In most cases, this is due to an increased need related to disease, aging, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.  displays the water- and fat-soluble vitamins and gives situations where vitamin supplementation may need to occur.

NTDs result from a developmental error in the closure of the neural tube early in pregnancy and are one of the most common congenital disabilities in North America (National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). The fortification program is estimated to have increased mean folic acid intakes in the U.S. by about 200 mcg/day, a substantial increase. An unintentional consequence of folate fortification is that all people consuming the folate fortified foods receive extra folate, not just women of childbearing age. However, in the older adult, the consumption of folic acid from fortified foods increases the risk of ‘masking’ megaloblastic anemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency (van Gool et al., 2020).

Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
Vitamin C or ascorbic acid, a water-soluble vitamin, is best known for its coenzyme and antioxidant properties (Abiri &Vafa, 2021). Vitamin C protects cells from premature aging caused by free radicals. Vitamin C stabilizes the cell by accepting or donating an electron. The body is constantly moving electrons around, so vitamin C is used in almost every tissue in the body. Free radicals are the leading cause of disease and inflammation, so vitamin C’s ability to neutralize those free radicals (acting as an antioxidant) is central to lowering heart disease and cancer risk.
Vitamin C also promotes collagen synthesis. Although collagen synthesis is required for maintaining normal vascular function, it also provides metabolic substrates for new blood vessel development (angiogenesis), enhancing blood supply, and bringing more oxygen to the tissues. Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system and increases the absorption of non-heme iron.
The body tightly monitors the plasma concentration of vitamin C. Approximately 70–90% of vitamin C is absorbed in moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. Absorption becomes less efficient at doses above 1,000 mg/day, with about 50% of the excess excreted in the urine (NIH, 2021b). Most healthy, non-smoking Americans consume enough vitamin C-rich foods to meet the daily requirements of 90 mg/day for males and 75 mg/day for females. According to national nutrition studies, the average vitamin C intake is about 95 mg/day without vitamin supplementation. See  for common fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C.

Vitamin C Levels in Common Foods (source: NIH, 2021a)
Large doses of vitamin C can have an adverse effect in people with a family history of kidney or gallstones. Supplementing vitamin C at a level three times or more of the RDA (approximately 3,000 mg) can double the amount of oxalate filtering through the kidney and greatly increases the chance of stone formation.
Absorption of water-soluble vitamins occurs in the small intestine through the process of diffusion or, in the case of riboflavin, by a carrier molecule and enters the bloodstream. Many water-soluble vitamins function as coenzymes in other cellular reactions and may require additional chemical action before tissues use them. Differences in ease of absorption or food bioavailability, dosage, and chemical form of the vitamin all influence the amount of the vitamin absorbed in the small intestine (Ofoedu et al., 2021).
Smoking and Increased Vitamin C Needs
Clients who smoke should increase their vitamin C by 35 mg/day. They have decreased plasma concentrations of this antioxidant due to an increase in free radicals. According to Lykkesfeldt and Tveden-Nyborg (2019), “Active smoking typically depletes the vitamin C pool by 25–50% compared to never-smokers.”
Certain populations or disease states require vitamin supplementation. In most cases, this is due to an increased need related to disease, aging, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.  displays the water- and fat-soluble vitamins and gives situations where vitamin supplementation may need to occur.

Vitamin Intake for Wellness
To help consumers make healthy food choices and consume adequate amounts of vitamins, the FDA mandates that foods carry a nutrition facts food label. Although the label does not display every vitamin or mineral,  is an example nutrition food label, outlining the most important nutrient information deemed by the FDA (2022a).
This nutrition facts food label shows percent DVs of one serving (1 cup) of a food item. (credit: “Sample Label for Frozen Lasagna”/U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Public Domain)
The nutrition facts food label in  indicates that this food item is low in added sugars and vitamin D and is considered high in saturated fat, calcium, and sodium. Restated more simply, one serving of this food item provides one-quarter of the daily calcium and saturated fat requirements and over one-third of the daily allowance for sodium, if consuming approximately 2,000 calories daily. Usually, a meal consists of more than one food item, so adding naturally low-sodium and low-fat foods like fresh fruit or vegetables will help to balance this food nutritionally.
Individual food manufacturers create nutrition facts labels based on the amount of nutrients in a standard serving size of that food. The percent Daily Value (DV) is the percentage of the nutrient the food item provides for an adult consuming about 2,000 calories daily. FDA guidance states that 5% DV or less of a nutrient per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of a nutrient per serving is considered high (FDA, 2022). Note that reaching 100% of the DV for sugar, fat, saturated fat, and sodium should not be a target or goal.
Nutrient Daily Values Reference Guide
The FDA recently updated their reference guide of DVs. A review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website shows how nutrient recommendations increased or decreased since the last review.
Part A
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.
Curtis, a third grader who has a long history of being a picky eater, does not like getting up early, so most days he does not eat breakfast before leaving for school. He also does not like the school-provided lunch, so his Auntie sends him to school with a commercially packaged and processed lunch of cheese and meat with crackers. After school, Curtis has a two-pack of toaster pastries with a glass of water, and his mom or Auntie usually makes him a box of macaroni and cheese for supper—they know he will eat it without a complaint. During his last visit to the pediatrician, Curtis’s mom voiced frustration with Curtis’s eating habits and wondered if he was getting all his vitamins and minerals. After checking Curtis’s height and weight, the pediatrician explained that Curtis was at the 95th percentile for weight and advised Mom to serve more fruits and vegetables and monitor his weight. Mom conveyed this information to Auntie, Curtis’s primary caregiver.
To answer the following questions, search the Internet for food label information on a combo lunch pack (such as Lunchables), boxed macaroni and cheese, and toaster pastries.

Meal Planning
Cooking techniques can impact the retention of water-soluble vitamins. The best cooking techniques for preserving water-soluble vitamins in vegetables include stir-frying, microwaving, and steaming. Each of these limits the amount of water and shortens cooking time, which decreases lost vitamins.
Vitamins B1, B2, and folate are sensitive to heat or light. Exposure to heat for as little as five minutes can decrease the content of the vitamin by as much as 90%. Vitamin C is degraded by heat and can begin to decrease within five minutes of exposure to a high temperature. For the best retention of a vitamin, cook for a shorter time, use less water, and lower the temperature.
Another way of maximizing vitamin intake is through intentional meal planning. MyPlate from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is a simple tool for building a meal rich in vitamins and minerals that focuses on nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, lean meat, and dairy. Another effective way to present a balanced and nutrient-rich meal is to create a plate of one-quarter protein, one-quarter high carbohydrate or starchy food, and one-half fruits and vegetables.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the nutritional function of minerals.
Identify the impact of minerals on wellness promotion and illness prevention.
Examine special considerations for populations that face challenges securing adequate mineral intake.

Mineral Function
Minerals are common in cereals, bread, meat, fish, milk, dairy, nuts, fruit (especially in dried form), and vegetables. About 20 minerals are essential for body function, all in varying amounts depending on their role. The macrominerals are needed at levels higher than 100 mg/day, and trace minerals are needed in amounts less than 100 mg/day (Farag et al., 2023).  lists the macro (M) and trace (T) minerals and their functions.
Mineral
Function
Calcium (M)
Contributes to the structure of bones and teeth and controls blood vessel contraction and dilation, muscle function, blood clotting, nerve transmission, and hormone secretion
Phosphorus (M)
Contributes to the structure of bones and teeth and to the genetic material of DNA and RNA
Potassium (M)
Maintains intracellular fluid volume and is important for muscle contraction, specifically heart contractions
Sodium (M)
Maintains extracellular fluid volume and plays a crucial role in normal nerve and muscle function
Chloride (M)
Plays a role in acid–base homeostasis, contributes to maintenance of urine and plasma electroneutrality, and may even effect neurohormonal activation (Soliman et al., 2022)
Magnesium (M)
Responsible for activation of enzymes, membrane function, intracellular signaling, and muscle contraction
Sulfur (M)
Operates as a cofactor involved in regulating oxidative processes and is an endogenous metabolite of the amino acid, methionine
Iron (T)
Helps develop red blood cells, metabolize cellular energy metabolism, and develop the immune system
Zinc (T)
Performs the role of antioxidant by protecting cell membranes from free radical damage as a coenzyme of more than 300 enzymes
Iodine (T)
Serves as a necessary component of thyroid hormones
Chromium (T)
May facilitate the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins by increasing the effectiveness of insulin—the precise mechanism for this activity has yet to be identified
Copper (T)
Operates as a cofactor in the process of cellular oxidation and is required for the oxidation of iron
Fluoride (T)
Promotes remineralization of bones and teeth
Molybdenum (T)
Aids in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids and is an enzyme cofactor
Manganese (T)
Serves as a cofactor for enzyme productions related to protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism; functions as antioxidant
Selenium (T)
Removes excess hydrogen peroxide from thyroid and is also needed for DNA synthesis
Essential Minerals and Their Functions
Minerals work synergistically. For example, the sodium-to-potassium ratio is essential in maintaining normal blood pressure and impacts blood pressure more than sodium or potassium alone. Likewise, the proper relationship between calcium and phosphorus is vital in maintaining normal bone structure. As with vitamins, one mineral cannot assume the function of another mineral, and a shortage or deficiency of any mineral will impact body function.
Mineral absorption takes place primarily in the small intestine. For some minerals, absorption efficiency depends on specific needs such as calcium absorption in pregnancy. During pregnancy, calcium absorption takes place actively, which requires energy to transport across the cell membrane. In times of plentiful serum calcium, the body switches to a passive diffusion method of absorption.
Mineral absorption can be helped or hindered by other dietary components that occur naturally in food. For example, iron is best absorbed in an acid environment, so health professionals recommend taking an iron supplement with orange juice. Juxtaposed is the absorption of minerals in the presence of phytates (found in whole grains) that interfere with calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc absorption.
National Institutes of Health
The NIH provides thorough information on their website about dietary supplements, herbs, vitamins, probiotics, and more.

Mineral Intake for Wellness
Minerals play an essential role in various metabolic and physiologic processes. A deeper dive into cellular nutrition reveals that minerals are critical for the metabolism of every cell in the body. A well-balanced mineral intake is essential throughout the human lifecycle, although specific needs may vary based on age and sex (Farag, et al., 2023). For example, the iron needs of premenopausal clients are higher than postmenopausal clients because of the iron loss during menstruation. A diet comprised of vegetables, legumes, nuts, lean meats, and seafood provides all the essential minerals needed throughout a person’s life.
Food fortification (the practice of intentionally increasing the content of one or more micronutrients) makes meeting the required mineral DV easier. For example, in the mid-1920s, in response to an increase in goiter, iodine was added to table salt (Leung, Braverman, and Pearce, 2012). Goiter is an increase in thyroid size resulting from either iodine deficiency or hyperthyroidism. Vitamin D was first added to milk in 1933 in response to the presence of childhood rickets (IOM, 2003; United Nations, 2019). Today, food fortification continues. Two more current examples are the addition of calcium to orange juice and iron and folate to breakfast cereals. Even though some breakfast cereals are fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, many should not be considered nutritionally sound because they are high in added sugar. Fortification does not guarantee nutritional excellence.
Mineral Daily Values
As with vitamins, there are also mineral DV percentages. You can find vitamin and mineral information on the NIH website, which contains a list of vitamins and minerals with hyperlinks to more detailed information on each (select the mineral of interest and then proceed to the option of health professional).
Micronutrients
Research indicates an increasing use of micronutrient supplements, specifically single-nutrient supplements (Cowan et al, 2020). Is it better to take a supplement to ensure you have an adequate supply of micronutrients, or is it possible to get the micronutrients your body needs via food sources? 
Social media influencers promote awareness of micronutrient consumption in a person’s diet as a way to assess their individual levels. TicToker @TheWellnessPharm suggests that individuals use a micronutrient testing kit to help determine if they have consistently low levels of specific nutrients. Once identified, individuals can correct deficiencies to promote wellness and enhance disease prevention. Similarly, Instagram hosts several forums dedicated to the discussion of obtaining daily micronutrient requirements from specific foods, often promoting intuitive or mindful eating practice.

However, it is important to note that while supplements can be beneficial for individuals with specific deficiencies or medical conditions, they are not a substitute for a well-balanced diet. In fact, excessive intake of certain minerals through supplements can lead to toxicity and adverse health effects. It is always best to obtain essential minerals through a varied and balanced diet. Additionally, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on individual health needs and potential interactions with medications or existing health conditions.","al, 2020). eer t smnt to noe ate supplments  be eeici or ndviduals wit spii deiinies or medial conition they ae no  sustiute or wellaance diet.

Examine special considerations for the nutritional needs associated with vulnerable populations and across the lifespan.

Regulations and Recommendations for the Use of Supplements
Eating a diet with fresh and minimally processed foods is the best source of vitamins and minerals. However, even people with healthy eating habits sometimes need help to bridge occasional nutrient gaps, and supplements may help.
Deciding on the right vitamin-mineral supplement can be difficult, considering that hundreds of different types are available and no real guidance is provided at the point of sale (NIH, 2018). With almost 60 percent (Mishra et al., 2021) of the population taking multiple vitamin and mineral supplements, guidance is important. Certain people are more likely to need a supplement including those with the following characteristics (Weyh et al., 2022):
With restricted diets
Who are pregnant
With loss of appetite due to sickness, injury, or surgery—note that vitamin/mineral supplements alone do not provide calories or protein needed for healing
With severe food allergies resulting in a restricted diet
With a depleted immune system
Broadly, vitamin-mineral supplements are divided into three main groups: basic, high-potency, and specialized (). Examples of when each group would apply include the following:
Basic—individuals needing to bridge occasional vitamin and mineral gaps
High-potency—pregnant women have higher iron and folate needs and need a diet formulated for prenatal care
Specialized—clients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) may need to supplement with specific vitamins and minerals: vitamin C (500 mg), vitamin E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg), which is effective in slowing AMD (NIH-National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 2018; NIH, 2023)
Vitamin-Mineral Category
Description
Basic (broad spectrum)
These vitamins have a usual daily dosage and contain a variety of vitamins in minerals in amounts that do not exceed the DVs. Many of the vitamins in this group are developed for men, women, seniors, and children to better meet the unique needs of age and sex.
High-potency
These multivitamin/minerals (MVMs) contain amounts of some vitamins and minerals that are well over 100% of the percent DV. They might also include other nutrients and botanical ingredients. These high-potency vitamins may be marketed in multiple packages for convenince and daily use.
Specialized (condition-specific)
These MVMs are used for different needs like immune function, eye health, or athletic performance. They are often combinations of vitamins, minerals, botanicals, probiotics, and coenzymes. Some of these products include nutrients much higher than the percent DV.
Categories of Vitamin and Mineral Supplements (source: NIH, 2023a)
Vitamin-mineral supplements fall under the regulatory powers of the FDA. However, the weak regulation and the vast array of supplements can confuse the consumer. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 altered the FDA’s authority to regulate dietary supplements (NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, 1994). Under DSHEA, the FDA does not authorize or evaluate dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before reaching store shelves; unfortunately, this makes a “buyer beware” situation. Vitamin manufacturers can lawfully introduce dietary supplements without even notifying the FDA. Since DSHEA was enacted, the dietary supplement market has exploded, with the number of products multiplying nearly 20 times since 1994 (FDA, 2022).

Supplements and Nutritional Plans
Nurses should take a food-first approach to vitamins and minerals as the most prudent advice for clients. Food has multiple advantages over a manufactured pill by providing complex carbohydrates, fiber, protein, unsaturated fats, and antioxidants.
 is an example of a food-first approach with a diet full of vitamins and minerals from dairy, legumes, lean meat, nuts, fish, fruits, and vegetables. A vitamin and mineral-rich daily menu could be as simple as the following meals:
Breakfast—cereal with 5 g or less of added sugar, low-fat animal or plant milk (fortified with calcium and Vitamin D), and a banana
Lunch—carrot sticks, a tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread, and orange sections
Snack—roasted almonds
Dinner—broiled pork chop, collards, and lightly salted sweet potato fries (air-fried)
Vitamin/Mineral
Food Source/Serving Size
Vitamin A
One small carrot provides 6,000 IU of vitamin A (100% of DV)
Vitamin B3 (niacin)
Three ounces of tuna has 11 mg of niacin (about 50% of DV)
Vitamin B6
One medium banana contains about 0.4 mg vitamin B6 (about 25% of DV)
Vitamin E
One ounce of almonds has over 7 mg vitamin E (about 50% of DV)
Vitamin B1
One 3 oz porkchop provides 0.4 mg of thiamin (33% of DV)
Vitamin C
One medium orange provides 70 mg of vitamin C (78% of DV)
Vitamin D
Eight ounces of fortified milk contains 100 IU vitamin D (25% of DV)
Selenium
One slice of whole wheat bread contains 10 mcg of selenium (about 20% of DV)
Calcium
One cup of boiled collard greens contains 266 mg of calcium ( about 26% of DV)
Zinc
Three ounces of lean beef contains 5 mg of zinc ( about 50% of DV)
Examples of Vitamins and Minerals Found in Common Food Sources (Note that all of the above-mentioned foods contain multiple vitamins and minerals.)
According to the National Institute of Health (NIH-National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 2018), supplement manufacturers can make three health-related claims on their labels:
Health—describes a relationship between a food, food component, or dietary supplement ingredient and reducing the risk of a specific disease or health-related condition
Nutrient—describes the relative amount of a nutrient or dietary substance in a product
Structure or function—describes how a product may affect the organs or systems of the body and cannot mention any specific disease
The dosage of specific vitamin and mineral supplements a client should consume will vary because the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) differs based on age and sex. For example, note the differences in recommended daily iron intake for each of these groups:
Adolescent (age 12 to 18 years) female: 15 mg
Adolescent (age 12 to 18 years) male: 11 mg
Adult (age 18 plus years) female: 18 mg
Adult (age 18 plus years) male: 8 mg
Because of specific needs, vitamin-mineral supplements are customized and marketed to population segments based on activity and age. For example, vitamins for children sport bright and catchy labels, gummy textures, and fruity tastes. Prenatal vitamins often have labels with pastel colors. Supplements for older adults are packaged in silver labeled bottles. Vitamin-mineral supplements can also be found as liquid drinks, including water, milk, and coffee.
Clients may ask if they need a vitamin-mineral supplement. There is little scientific support for taking a vitamin-mineral supplement when no deficiency signs and symptom exist (Seres, 2023); foods provide many vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals and are more bioavailable than those found in supplements (Harguth, 2022). In some situations, vitamin-mineral supplements are essential for good health, but promoting food as the first line of health defense is strongly supported by science and health professionals.

Recommended Dietary Allowance
The RDAs are published by the Food and National Academies of Sciences every five to 10 years. RDAs were developed during World War II for nutritional guidance in feeding soldiers and food relief in the U.S. and internationally. They were set at the minimum level for good health and not every nutrient has an RDA (Murphy et al., 2016). The nutrients listed in the RDA are used as a goal for healthy individuals at every age. They are preventative in nature and not meant to be treatment for disease.
Dietary Guidelines are updated every five years; they help interpret and apply the RDAs to dietary patterns. In 1985, the Dietary Guidelines scientific report supporting their recommendations totaled 19 pages. In the 2020 version, the total was over 800 pages, demonstrating the prolific research occurring over the past 40 years on vitamins and minerals, dietary patterns, and health. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines’ call to action “Make Every Bite Count” includes four overarching values:
Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage
Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations
Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits
Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and limit alcoholic beverages (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020)
These Dietary Guidelines are reflected throughout this chapter as nutrient-dense foods are emphasized over supplements.

Part B
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Part A.
After Curtis’s last visit to the pediatrician Auntie tries to introduce some of her favorite Haitian dishes to Curtis such as rice with a pork sauce, beef and pumpkin soup, and banana fritters. Curtis refuses to taste any of the native Haitian foods. Auntie is now watching several other children after school in addition to Curtis, and Mom continues to work rotating shifts and extra hours. Curtis spends most of the school year eating the same limited number of foods for lunch, snacks, and dinner. He rejects all attempts to include fruits and vegetables in his diet; it is cheaper, easier, and faster to adhere to Curtis’s food preferences.
Curtis is sick more often than his classmates, which causes him to miss many days of school and fall behind in his work. His mom is concerned and asks the school nurse what she should do about his inability to fight infections. The school nurse indicates Curtis’ picky eating habits were contributing to frequent illness.
A well-rounded, varied diet of mostly unprocessed foods will provide many of the DVs recommended by the FDA.
High doses of water-soluble vitamins are excreted in the urine, although fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the tissues. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins can lead to toxicity and even death.
Certain disease states require higher vitamin and mineral intake, supplemented beyond dietary sources. 
Vitamin-mineral supplements should be selected based on age, sex, and specific need.
Coenzyme and antioxidant properties are critical functions of vitamins and minerals.
Nutrition facts food labels and MyPlate can assist in choosing foods high in vitamins and minerals.
RDAs and DVs reflect current nutrient research.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Describe the digestion process.
Describe the organs of digestion.
Identify congenital anomalies within digestive organs.

The Digestion Process
The digestive process includes four steps: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism. Ingestion is the first step and involves the process of bringing food and liquids into the body through the mouth. Next is digestion, in which the body breaks down solid food through a systemic process that includes both mechanical and chemical actions to form smaller, more absorbable substances for the gastrointestinal tract (Patricia & Dhamoon, 2022). Absorption is when cells take in the broken-down substances, and metabolism is when those absorbed substances are converted to energy.
Digestion occurs as an integrated process between the body’s upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory organs. The body needs to have proper digestive processes to ensure correct function. Common end products of digestion are amino acids, simple carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals.

Digestive Organs
The main organs of digestion, known as the gastrointestinal system, begin at the mouth and end at the anus. This system is divided into the upper gastrointestinal system, which starts at the mouth and ends at the duodenum (the start of the small intestine), and the lower gastrointestinal system, which starts at the small intestine and includes the large intestine (the colon, rectum, and anus). Other organs in the digestive system that aid in digestion but are not part of the main gastrointestinal system and don’t come in direct contact with food are the accessory organs: the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder ().
The digestive system consists of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory systems and is responsible for processing food. The main digestive organs, known as the gastrointestinal system, begin at the mouth and end at the anus. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The purpose of the digestive system, and all the systems that work in harmony with it, is to receive food, release nutrients and water from the food, and transport these nutrients to the bloodstream for energy production. The digestive system is also responsible for absorbing water from the colon and for excreting nondigestible solid waste from the anus (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022).

Upper Gastrointestinal System
The upper gastrointestinal system comprises the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The teeth, tongue, and salivary glands, which are all accessories for digestion, are in the mouth and facilitate the breakdown of food through mechanical (chewing) and chemical (enzymes) digestive processes. Without any one of these components, the mouth would not be able to complete its role in the digestive process effectively.
After this initial breakdown, food then travels out of the mouth, through the upper esophageal sphincter, down the esophagus, through the lower esophageal sphincter, into the stomach, out of the stomach through the pyloric sphincter, and into the duodenum (). The process of digestion through this upper gastrointestinal tract, starting at the mouth and ending in gastric emptying, can take two to five hours to complete (Readman, 2022).
Food journeys from the esophagus to the duodenum. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Lower Gastrointestinal System
The lower gastrointestinal system comprises the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. Food entering the lower portion of the gastrointestinal system comes from the duodenum as chyme, a mixture of gastric juices and digested food. After digestive processes are complete in the duodenum, chyme moves through the small intestine, large intestine, and rectum, then out the body through the anus in the form of stool. Digestion through the lower gastrointestinal tract can take from 12 to 65 hours (Readman, 2022).

Accessory Organs and Systems
The pancreas, liver, and gallbladder are organs outside of the main gastrointestinal tract but are part of the digestive system (GI Associates and Endoscopy Center, 2022b). They directly aid in digestion by releasing enzymes and digestive fluids. Cholecystokinin, a hormone produced by the small intestine, triggers the pancreas and gallbladder to contract when fats and proteins enter. The pancreas, while also responsible for other body functions, produces amylase, lipase, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, nucleases, and protease. These enzymes break down sugars, fats, and starches (GI Associates and Endoscopy Center, 2022b). When sugar enters the bloodstream, the pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that assists in the absorption of glucose into cells to use for energy.
The liver produces bile, a digestive fluid that is stored in the gallbladder. When fatty foods enter the duodenum, the gallbladder releases bile to break down the fat into fatty acids. If the gallbladder is removed, the bile will instead travel directly from the liver to the small intestine.
Other accessory organs and tissues that assist in digestion include the salivary glands, tongue, nerves, and blood (University of Rochester Medical Center, 2022). When food enters the mouth and chewing begins, teeth break down the food into smaller parts, and saliva is released. Saliva is released by the sensory system, which is stimulated by sight, smell, and taste. Glands and mucosal membranes of the intestinal walls secrete small amounts of digestive enzymes and lubricating mucus to assist with waste movement and nutrient absorption.

Congenital Anomalies of the Gastrointestinal System
While rare, congenital anomalies can affect the digestive system. Most congenital anomalies result from undeveloped or incorrectly positioned organs, causing blockages that prevent food passage or the exit of waste products (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.).
Atresia, Stenosis, and Malformations
Congenital abnormalities include atresia, stenosis, and malformations. Some of these abnormalities can be detected in utero or soon after birth, while others remain undetected through childhood until they cause physical symptoms (Ludwig et al., 2022). Atresia is a condition in which a passage in the body is blocked. For example, esophageal atresia is when a baby’s esophagus has not developed correctly, and aural atresia is when the ear canal is underdeveloped. Stenosis, or narrowing, is a partial blockage of an area, and a malformation is an abnormal formation of a specific body part.
Anorectal anomalies can include an anus that is very narrow or totally enclosed by a layer of tissue or skin, a rectum that does not connect to the anus (imperforate anus), or a rectum that connects to a part of the urinary or reproductive tract through a fistula, an abnormal connection (Boston Children’s Hospital, 2022). Depending on which anomaly is present, the client may experience symptoms such as difficulty passing stool and constipation, total inability to have a bowel movement, or stool that exits through the urinary system or another system in the body, causing infection and incontinence (Boston Children’s Hospital, 2022).
Biliary anomalies affect the bile ducts. They can involve a progressive narrowing effect and/or a complete blockage, cystic formations that result in blockages in the biliary system, or biliary ducts that are malformed and do not properly connect to the pancreaticobiliary junction (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.; Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, 2023b). These anomalies fall into two main types, cystic and non-cystic. Cystic anomalies are caused by saclike structures filled with pus or other fluid that form and block different parts of the biliary system, whereas non-cystic anomalies are actual structural defects of the biliary system (Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, 2023). Common symptoms of these anomalies include jaundice, abdominal pain, pale or clay-colored stools, dark urine, enlarged liver margins, hyperamylasemia, enlarged splenic margins, and difficulty gaining weight.
Malrotation and Volvulus
Malrotation most often occurs in the small intestine and involves an incorrect rotation that happens during fetal development (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). Volvulus is a severe complication of a malrotation in which blood flow is blocked to the digestive tract, causing ischemia, and/or to the intestines, causing stool blockage (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). While malrotation can be the cause of volvulus, it can also occur in the absence of malrotation (John Hopkins Medicine, 2022).
Malrotations alone are usually asymptomatic. It is not until volvulus develops that a client experiences symptoms (John Hopkins Medicine, 2022) such as sudden and severe nausea and vomiting, dark red or bloody stools, severe constipation or difficulty expelling stools, abdominal distention, bilious vomiting (vomiting that contains bile), and shock.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Outline the assessment process of the digestive organs.
Analyze and prioritize assessment findings.

Mouth, Oropharynx, and Lips
Because digestion is responsible for fueling the body, proper assessment of the digestive system is imperative to prevent disease, maintain wellness, and promote nutritional health. Both a physical assessment and a review of the client’s health history should be completed. In reviewing the client’s health history, the nurse should inquire about medical history, dietary practices, dietary intolerances or allergies, eating and bowel patterns, changes in eating or bowel patterns, recent unintentional weight loss or gain, and medical diagnoses or surgical history. The nurse should obtain the client’s weight and height to calculate the client’s body mass index (BMI).
An assessment of the mouth and the oropharynx (the middle part of the throat) begins with the lips. The nurse should begin with the outer lips to judge for symmetry, color, texture, and contouring. The client should be asked to smile so that the nurse can judge lip symmetry. If the client is unable to lift both sides of the lips equally, they are not symmetrical, and this should be reported.
Lip Asymmetry
If the client is exhibiting asymmetry in their lips that is new, especially in conjunction with new symptoms such as facial drooping or asymmetry, arm weakness, numbness, paralysis, or speech difficulty such as slurring or aphasia, the nurse should immediately alert the provider, as this could indicate an acute stroke (American Stroke Association, n.d.).
Next, the inner lips and buccal mucosa (the inner lining of the cheeks) should be inspected for color, texture, moisture, and presence of abnormalities. To best visualize these structures, the nurse should direct the client to relax their mouth. The nurse should then pull the bottom lip outward and away from the client’s teeth by grasping the lip between the thumb and index finger on each side and carefully pulling outward (Villa, 2022). Drooling may be seen in young infants and toddlers up to age two, but it should not be excessive.
Nurses should watch for numerous abnormalities, some more urgent than others. Assessment findings that the nurse should report immediately include cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin that can indicate low oxygen levels, and new unilateral asymmetry with movement, as this could indicate a cerebrovascular accident.
Gums, Buccal Mucosa, Tongue, and Teeth
The inspection of the inside of the mouth will include the gums, buccal mucosa, tongue, and teeth. To begin, the client should open their mouth. The nurse should then use a penlight and a tongue depressor or blade to retract each cheek to complete a visual exam of all internal surfaces, looking for any abnormalities. To evaluate the teeth in the back of the mouth, the nurse should place both index fingers into one side of the mouth to retract the cheek. The client will then slowly open and close their mouth while the cheek is retracted so that tooth alignment can be visualized. This should be completed on both sides of the mouth.
Nurses should inspect the gums in this same manner. If the client has dentures, bridges, or other removable dental appliances, they should be removed if possible, and the nurse should repeat the evaluation for the gums separately. Check gums for retraction or recession, color, reddened inflammation, soreness, bleeding, edema, or lesions (Cleveland Clinic, 2022c).
Tongue Depressor or Blade Contradictions
If the epiglottis (the small cartilage that covers the windpipe) is swollen, the nurse should not examine with a tongue depressor, blade, or flexible laryngoscope. Further, the nurse should not manipulate the oral cavity because this could trigger laryngospasm and close off the client’s airway, causing a life-threatening emergency (Guerra & Waseem, 2022). Symptoms of epiglottitis include hyperthermia, sore throat, stridor (noisy breathing), dysphagia (trouble swallowing), and drooling (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Children may also act anxious and irritable and may sit up or lean forward to ease breathing, while adults may also have a muffled or hoarse voice or difficulty breathing.
Tongue and Mouth Floor
To facilitate inspection of the tongue, the client should open their mouth and stick out their tongue to allow the nurse to inspect for position, color, texture, and moisture. The nurse should ask the client to curl their tongue upward and move it from side to side to assess mobility. Lastly, the nurse should instruct the client to push the tip of their tongue to the roof of their mouth and should inspect the base of the tongue, the mouth floor, and the frenulum (the small tissue beneath the tongue that provides support) for color, texture, bleeding, moisture, and lesions.
The hard and soft palates at the roof of the mouth should be inspected for color, shape, texture, and the presence of bony prominences. The nurse should instruct the client to open their mouth widely while tilting their head backward. The nurse should use a tongue depressor or blade to depress the tongue if needed and use a penlight to see the structures. The nurse should then ask the client to say “ah” and should inspect the uvula, the fleshy extension that hangs at the back of the throat and at the end of the soft palate, for position and mobility after inspecting the soft palate.
Palates, Uvula, Oropharynx, and Tonsils
The final steps of the assessment cover the palates, uvula, oropharynx, and tonsils. To begin, the nurse should use a tongue depressor or blade to push downward against the tongue halfway back on the same side of the tongue of the oropharynx that is being inspected. While holding the tongue out of the way, the nurse should use a penlight to examine the color, size, and discharge of the oropharynx and tonsils. The inspection should be repeated on the opposite side. Lastly, the nurse should elicit the gag reflex by using the tongue depressor or blade to stimulate the back of the throat (Sivakumar & Prabhu, 2023).
As with the teeth and gum assessment, abnormal findings that the nurse should report immediately include cyanosis and any suspicious lesions. Additional findings that the nurse should immediately report include a uvula that is not midline or freely movable (this could be a sign of a tumor, trauma, or nerve damage), a uvula in a newborn that is forked or bifurcated (a possible indication of an undetected cleft palate), plaques or drainage in oropharynx (this could indicate acute infection), or swelling or drainage of tonsils (possible sign of an acute infection).

Abdomen
The assessment of the abdomen includes the upper gastrointestinal system (stomach and duodenum), the accessory organs of the digestive system (pancreas, liver, and gallbladder), and most of the lower gastrointestinal system (large and small intestines). This assessment must occur in a specific order: inspection, auscultation, percussion, and then palpation. This is important because auscultating before percussing and palpating ensures the nurse is listening to undisturbed bowel sounds.
Positioning the Client for Abdominal Assessment
When preparing the client for abdominal assessment, position them so that their abdominal wall musculature is relaxed. To achieve this, the nurse should have the client lie supine and support the client’s head and behind the knees with pillows.
Step 1: Inspection
Inspection should be the first step in the abdominal assessment (Roscoe, 2022). The nurse should do this with the client in a completely supine position with the abdomen exposed (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022). The nurse should inspect the skin integrity, abdomen contour, symmetry, and vascular patterns and visually inspect the abdominal movement associated with respirations, aortic blood flow, and peristalsis (the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract).
Step 2: Auscultation
Auscultation is the process of listening to the sounds of the body using a stethoscope. The process of auscultating the abdomen is to assess the bowel and vascular sounds and peritoneal friction rubs. To auscultate the abdomen, the nurse should:
With the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen for bowel sounds in each of the four quadrants of the abdomen. Calculate the amount of time in between bowel sounds after listening for at least two and no more than five minutes in each quadrant.
With the bell of the stethoscope, listen for the absence of bruits (the sound of blood flowing through a narrowed portion of an artery) in the aorta, renal arteries, femoral arteries, and iliac arteries in the abdomen. If the nurse suspects a delay in gastric emptying, place the stethoscope on the abdomen near the stomach, hold the client’s hips, and gently shake them from side to side while listening to their abdomen for a succussion splash, a sloshing or splashing sound caused by excessive fluid remaining in the stomach (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022). This may be uncomfortable for the client, so the nurse should inform the client what to expect.
With the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen for the absence of peritoneal friction rubs over the spleen and liver as the client breathes in deeply.
Step 3: Percussion
Percussion, or tapping, of the abdomen is an assessment technique to determine the presence of gas, fluid, or masses. The systematic process of percussion is to start in the lower-right quadrant of the abdomen and proceed to the upper-right quadrant, move to the upper-left quadrant, and finish in the lower-left quadrant. The nurse should percuss several areas of each quadrant to listen to the quality of the sound. Tympany, or a resonant, hollow sound, relates to gas, or flatus. Dullness, decrease, absence, or flatness of sound relates to fluid or solid masses.
Percussion is also used to best judge the size of the liver and may be helpful in identifying splenic enlargement (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022). To percuss for splenic size, the nurse should percuss the most inferior interspace on the left anterior axillary line, or the Castell’s point, as the client breathes in deeply, to listen for the start of dullness from tympany to discover the splenic edge. On the right side, the nurse should percuss down from the lung and up from the bowel to discover the change from tympany to dullness to locate the liver margins.
Step 4: Palpation
The last step in the abdominal assessment is palpation. There are three palpation stages: superficial or light palpation, deep palpation, and organ palpation. For superficial palpation, the nurse should hold their palm slightly above the client’s abdomen with their fingers parallel and then use their finger pads to depress the abdominal wall lightly at only about 1 cm (0.39 in), which is about the level of the subcutaneous tissue (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022). The nurse should move their finger pads in a circular motion over all the quadrants while noting any areas of tenderness, masses, crepitus (a grinding or crunching sound), irregularity in contour, or muscle guarding. If a known area of pain is already present on the abdomen, start farthest from the area of maximal pain with any form of palpation and end in that area last (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022).
After light palpation is complete, the nurse should move on to deep palpation. This is done slowly with the same hand position and in the same manner, except the depth of pressing is increased with firmer and more steady pressure to explore deeper. While palpating deeply in the periumbilical, inguinal, and suprapubic regions, the nurse should have the client cough while feeling for a mass to ensure there is no hidden hernia.
After palpation of the abdomen, the nurse should palpate the digestive organs. To palpate the liver, the nurse should place a hand below the lower-right rib margin and ask the client to exhale and then inhale deeply while the nurse feels for the margins and any nodularity. The nurse should then palpate the gallbladder by placing their palpating hand under the lower-right rib margin at the midclavicular line and asking the client to exhale deeply. The nurse then pushes in deeper and slowly, asking the client to inhale while watching for a sudden cessation of inhalation due to pain. The spleen is palpated by placing a hand in the lower-right quadrant and moving it toward the splenic flexure until the hand reaches the lower-left rib margin, at which time the client should be asked to exhale and then inhale deeply.
Deep Palpation Contraindications
The nurse should not do deep palpation on clients with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm, appendicitis, polycystic kidney disease, kidney transplant history, or a tender spleen because it could cause severe damage (Roscoe, 2022). For example, deep palpation may rupture an aneurysm, the appendix, or a cyst, or it may damage a newly transplanted kidney.
The nurse should report immediately abnormal findings that can indicate serious health problems within the lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory organs. Refer to  for a summary of possible abnormal findings and their causes.

While physical assessment can aid in identifying potential nutritional deficiencies, it is not diagnostic, and other follow-up testing is necessary to determine the best treatment needs and options.

Rectum and Anus
Assessment of the anus and rectum is the final step of the lower gastrointestinal system assessment. To assess the anus, the nurse should visually evaluate the outer tissue for color, integrity, and absence of lesions. The nurse should then ask the client to bear down as if defecating. With gloves on and the index finger lubricated, the nurse should feel the rectal sphincter and slowly dilate it by sliding the lubricated finger into the rectum. Palpate inside the rectum for masses, fissures, or other foreign bodies. After removal of the finger, inspect the finger for any signs of bleeding or melena (dark, black, or sticky feces). If present, or if internal bleeding is suspected, the nurse should perform a guaiac test, which will confirm if blood is present.
Important Newborn Assessment
For a newborn, the nurse should establish anal patency. This is done by two means: first, the nurse should insert a lubricated rectal thermometer 1 cm to 2 cm (0.39 in to 0.78 in) into the newborn’s rectum to record temperature, and second, the nurse should establish the passage of their first stool, called the meconium (Gantan & Wiedrich, 2022).

While palpating deeply in the periumbilical, inguinal, and suprapubic regions, the nurse should have the client cough while feeling for a mass to ensure there is no hidden hernia. After palpation of the abdomen, the nurse should palpate the digestive organs. To palpate the liver, the nurse should place a hand below the lower-right rib margin and ask the client to exhale and then inhale deeply while the nurse feels for the margins and any nodularity. The nurse should then palpate the gallbladder by placing their palpating hand under the lower-right rib margin at the midclavicular line and asking the client to exhale deeply. The nurse then pushes in deeper and slowly, asking the client to inhale while watching for a sudden cessation of inhalation due to pain. The spleen is palpated by placing a hand in the lower-right quadrant and moving it toward the splenic flexure until the hand reaches the lower-left rib margin, at which time the client should be asked to exhale and then inhale deeply. Deep Palpation Contraindications The nurse should not do deep palpation on clients with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm, appendicitis, polycystic kidney disease, kidney transplant history, or a tender spleen because it could cause severe damage (Roscoe, 2022). For example, deep palpation may rupture an aneurysm, the appendix, or a cyst, or it may damage a newly transplanted kidney. The nurse should report immediately abnormal findings that can indicate serious health problems within the lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory organs. findings abdominal masses, or the for signs of or which should to the and",54.480796586059746,"of the subcutaneous tissue (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022). The nurse should move their finger pads in a circular motion over all the quadrants while noting any areas of tenderness, masses, crepitus (a grinding or crunching sound), irregularity in contour, or muscle guarding. If a known area of pain is already present on the abdomen, start farthest from the area of maximal pain with any form of palpation and end in that area last (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022).

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Describe the function of digestive organs in ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination.
Describe the pathophysiology associated with digestive organs.
Identify the impact of aging on digestive organs.

Normal Function of the Digestive Organs
Before food ever enters the body, the sensory system starts the digestive process. The sight, smell, feel, and taste of food influences the desire to eat. These senses trigger the salivary glands to begin releasing saliva in the anticipation of eating, which helps break down food once it enters the oral cavity. When food enters the mouth, chewing, also known as mastication, starts the breakdown of food. The tongue secretes mucins and lingual lipase to help break down lipids. At the same time, the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular salivary glands release a mixture of buffers, glycoproteins known as mucins, and salivary amylase to lubricate the food for swallowing and to begin the digestion of complex carbohydrates and starches (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022; Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022).
Food then passes to the pharynx. To swallow food into the esophagus and not the trachea, the swallowing center in the brain stem of the central nervous system triggers certain actions:
The nasopharynx is closed off by the rise of the soft palate when the tongue initiates swallowing by pushing food to the back of the mouth.
The larynx is closed in the pharynx to prevent food from entering the trachea (Mealie, Ali, & Manthey, 2022; Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022).
Once this swallowing reflex is initiated, it cannot be stopped until completed.
Once food is swallowed, it enters the esophagus by passing through the upper esophageal sphincter. The food travels down the esophagus body involuntarily by way of a series of muscular contractions known as peristalsis. It then exits the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter into the stomach (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022).
While in the stomach, food is temporarily stored while mechanical and chemical processes break it down further into chyme. The stomach uses its three muscular layers (the inner oblique, middle circular, and external longitudinal layers) to contract and relax in a mixing and churning action to help mechanically break down food. To assist with the chemical breakdown of food, the stomach releases hydrochloric acid secreted by its parietal cells, enzymes such as pepsin, and hormones such as somatostatin and gastrin (Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022). The stomach is also responsible for secreting an intrinsic factor (a glycoprotein that is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12) from the parietal cells.
The food, in the form of chyme, exits the stomach through the pyloric sphincter into the first of the three segments of the small intestine, the duodenum. While in the duodenum, the pancreas (by way of the pancreatic duct) and liver (by way of the gallbladder and biliary tree) empty enzymes into the duodenum through the sphincter of Oddi. The liver secretes bile that is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder before it is released to aid in digestion (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022; Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022). The pancreas’s exocrine glands generate various enzyme precursors and enzymes that play a crucial role in the process of digestion (Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022).
Once completed, the food continues to the second segment of the small intestine, the jejunum, by way of peristalsis. This is where the bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption will occur before it moves into the last segment, the ileum, which has some digestive and absorptive duties as well (Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022). Absorption in the small intestine is done through nutrient exchange in extensive capillary networks that are located on the walls of the small intestine. The surface area of the small intestine is increased to promote increased absorption through the use of villi and microvilli that cover the walls and are home to the extensive capillary networks. There are also multiple exocrine and endocrine glands that assist in the absorptive process by producing and releasing hormones, alkaline mucinous materials, and enzymes.
Any undigested food materials that pass through to the end of the small intestine through the ileocecal valve end up in the cecum, which is the first of the five segments of the large intestine, as feces (Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022). While peristalsis moves the food through the large intestine, water and electrolytes are absorbed from the feces, and final digestion of undigested food particles in the feces is completed by microbes that live in the large intestine. Nutrients like vitamin K are produced and absorbed in the large intestine as well (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a; Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022). The feces travel through the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon before moving into the rectum, where stretch receptors signal the brain to defecate.
From the rectum, the stool exits the body through the anal canal by passing through the internal and then external anal sphincters. Relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is a reflexive action in response to the activation of the stretch receptors, and the relaxation of the external anal sphincter is a conscious process that allows for stool to exit the anus (Ogobuiro, Gonzales, & Tuma, 2022).

Aging of the Digestive System
The nurse should be aware of considerations for aging clients in connection with the digestive system and the role of nutrition. Older adults tend to have a decrease in appetite over younger adults due to comorbidities and/or medications that decrease the desire to eat, cause nausea, or create dietary food restrictions due to drug interactions. Older adults may experience the following issues:
Appetite can decrease due to a loss in smell or taste or changes in the release of the hormones that control appetite (e.g., ghrelin, peptide tyrosine, tyrosine, cholecystokinin, insulin, and leptin) (Nigam & Knight, 2017).
Food may appear less attractive or appetizing due to changes made to food consistency for safety reasons (Bartel, 2022; Nigam & Knight, 2017).
The feeling of being full may happen faster or last longer due to the stomach wall losing elasticity, resulting in a loss of hydrochloric acid secretion into the stomach, making food accommodation more difficult and gastric emptying slower.
Esophageal reflux may occur, and food may backflow more easily into the esophagus (Austin Gastroenterology, 2019).
Hyposecretion of hydrochloric acid and protective mucus that occurs with age can result in chronic atrophic gastritis, increased peptic ulcer disease, and decreased vitamin B12 absorption.
An increase in the bacterial populations in the small intestine may lead to increased bloating and abdominal pain as well as decreased absorption of calcium, folic acid, and iron (Bartel, 2022; Nigam & Knight, 2017).
Decreases in digestive enzymes from the pancreas result in a reduction in the digestion of proteins and fats.
The liver decreases bile production, rate of protein synthesis and metabolism, and its ability to detoxify substances (Nigam & Knight, 2017).
Risk for constipation increases because in the large intestine, there are reductions in neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors, atrophies of mucosa and muscle layers, formations of diverticula, declines in the rate of cell division in the digestive epithelium, and increases in inflammatory conditions due to the increase in facultative anaerobes. The increase in constipation increases the risk for hemorrhoid development.
Biological changes due to age make it important for an older client to be educated so that they eat nutrient-dense options for adequate nutritional intake. With a lower caloric intake demand due to a slower metabolic rate from aging, older adults’ need for calories will likely decrease, so the nutritional value of the foods they ingest is important.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Describe the homeostasis of gut health.
Describe the impact of diet on gut health.
Identify the impact of pharmacology on gut health.
Identify pathophysiology and gut health.

Gut Health Homeostasis
For healthy digestion and absorption of food and nutritional health, the gut must maintain a healthy homeostasis, the equilibrium maintained in the body through physiological processes and evidenced by intestinal microbiota growth. The nurse plays an important role in client education that leads to optimal nutritional health.
The composition of the gut’s microbial growth has a strong impact on the homeostasis of the gut. When the gut is not in a state of homeostasis, the imbalance that results can cause dysbiosis, a disruption to the gut microbiome. Many diseases have been linked to dysbiosis, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and diabetes, so the impact of an unhealthy gut surpasses just gastrointestinal health (Afzaal et al., 2022).
To maintain proper gut homeostasis, bacterial growth requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate and oxygen (Lee et al., 2022). Dietary factors, antibiotics, and underlying host conditions can reduce oxygen consumption in the colonic epithelium, thereby reducing the available oxygen to the indigenous microbes.
The microbiota of the gut has many functions in the body. These bacterial residents help control nutrient metabolism, defend against pathogens, contribute to carbohydrate digestion, synthesize methane from hydrogen processed by bacterial metabolism, neutralize carcinogens, and synthesize biotin, folate, and vitamin K (Afzaal et al., 2022).

Diet and Gut Health
Diet directly impacts the health of microbial growth (Lee et al., 2022). There are numerous foods that have a positive impact on gut health. For example, fiber, water intake, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and an overall well-balanced diet have shown positive effects. Yogurt is known to have a positive impact because it contains active bacterial cultures, which have been shown to be supportive of the gut microbiome environment (Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, 2023a). High-fat diets, in contrast, have been shown to have a negative impact. They tend to contribute to diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and colon cancer (Afzaal et al., 2022; Baton Rouge General, 2023). In addition, high sodium intake and alcohol use can contribute to dysbiosis and have been linked to hypertension.
A nurse can make a direct impact on client health by educating clients on why diet, gut microbiota, and homeostasis are important. The nurse should speak to the specific reasons why fiber, water, probiotics, and whole grains are valuable in a diet and why saturated fats, alcohol, and sodium are areas of concern. The nurse should discuss with the client so they understand which types of food to increase or decrease.  lists common foods and their impact on the gastrointestinal system.
Food
Impact on Gastrointestinal System
Fresh fruits and vegetables, lentils, kidney beans, split peas, chickpeas, quinoa, oats, popcorn, almonds, chia seeds, sweet potatoes, and dark chocolate
These foods are high in fiber and help maintain gut homeostasis, reduce cholesterol, promote healthy weight through satiety, reduce constipation by adding bulk to stool, and possibly reduce gastrointestinal cancer risks due to potential antioxidant properties (Gunnars, 2020; Moffitt Cancer Center, 2023).
Water
Increasing fiber requires increasing water in the diet to ensure there is sufficient water in the stool to account for the added bulk.
Saturated fats (found in fatty cuts of meat, pies, sausage, butter, lard, cheddar cheese, ice cream, sour cream, biscuits, cakes, pastries, milk chocolate confectionaries, palm oil, coconut oil, and coconut cream)
Saturated fats can lead to gut imbalance (Afzaal et al, 2022), raise bad cholesterol levels (NHS, 2023), and increase colon cancer risks (Baton Rouge General, 2023).
High-sodium foods (breads and rolls; pizza; sandwiches; cold cuts and cured meats; soups; burritos and tacos; savory snacks like chips, popcorn, pretzels, snack mixes, and crackers; chicken; cheese; and omelets)
High amounts of sodium can upset the homeostasis of the gut by increasing dehydration.
Common Foods and Liquids and the Gastrointestinal System

Pharmacology and Gut Health
Pharmacology and nutrition are interdependent because they rely on the same body processes. When the body lacks nutrients, the body’s ability to utilize certain drugs is impacted (Bhupathiraju & Hu, 2023). A lack in nutrients also impacts the body’s ability to properly dispose of toxins from drugs and digestion waste. The nutritional state of a client greatly impacts the ability of their medications to be properly metabolized, used, and excreted.
Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus, are supplements that are known to have positive impacts on the gut microbiome. These are useful in helping clients with dietary restrictions or who are taking certain medications that interfere with gut health. These supplements should be taken in combination with a healthy diet because they do not prevent gastrointestinal issues on their own but rather support healthy practices.
There are medications that can help and hurt the microbiota of the gut. Antibiotics are a well-known culprit for altering microbial growth. Long-term antibiotic use has been linked to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and colon cancer. When a client needs antibiotics for longer than three days, it is common practice that they also be given a probiotic to counteract some side effects and the possibility of infection.
There are other medications that are lesser known for being harmful. They include:
proton pump inhibitors to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can cause enteric infections like C. diff (Weersma et al., 2020);
metformin, used to treat diabetes mellitus, which can increase Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the intestines and lower other bacterium, causing imbalances in the microbiome;
statins to treat hyperlipidemia, which can cause constipation or diarrhea, upsetting the homeostasis in the gut;
antidepressants, which can kill off beneficial gut bacteria and alter the normal microbiome of the gut;
opioids to treat chronic pain, which can cause severe bouts of constipation, upsetting the microbiome and preventing the excretion of wastes from the body; and
laxatives, which can cause disruption of the microbiome through electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, and mineral deficiencies.

Pathophysiology and Gut Health
Gut health and its impact on the body are often discussed in relation to bidirectional crosstalk at an axis point between body systems that regulate health relative to one another (Tilg et al., 2022). The gut has many of these axes that connect it to the liver, brain, lung, nervous system, sensory system, etc. The following section will look at the gut and its connection with the liver, brain, and lung.
Gut-Liver, Gut-Brain, and Gut-Lung Axis
Gut-liver axis communication happens between nutrients, metabolites, microbial antigens, and bile acids within a microbial community (Ding et al., 2020; Tilg et al., 2022). A disturbance in this gut-liver network has been linked to an increase in hepatic inflammation and hepatic encephalopathy and decompensation of liver cirrhosis (Klein, 2022).
The gut-brain axis has been shown to have many devastatingly negative effects. The gut has been shown to produce neuroactive compounds that modulate metabolism and immunity (Benakis & Liesz, 2022), which are essential components to healing after a stroke. Because a stroke leads to intestinal dysmotility and permeability of the intestinal barrier, and thus decreased metabolism and depressed immunity, stroke victims often have impaired healing.  outlines some other diseases connected to the gut-brain connection.
Disease
Impact
Parkinson’s disease
Overgrowth of intestinal bacteria results in an increase in opportunistic pathogens, causing the neurotransmitter L-dopa to be decreased (Wallen et al., 2022). Parkinson’s disease is directly impacted by the availability of L-dopa, and symptoms are worsened when the availability is decreased.
Multiple sclerosis
Overgrowth of certain gut bacteria causes an imbalance in homeostasis; exacerbations and advancement of the disease can be affected (eBioMedicine, 2022; French, 2022).
Alzheimer’s disease
Clients with Alzheimer’s disease are shown to demonstrate excessive production and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides that lead to extracellular plaque formation (Sidharthan, 2022). Gut microbiota health impacts the disease because when it is unbalanced, it releases more of certain by-products that can alter inflammatory cytokine-signaling pathways, leading to amyloid-beta peptide accumulation.
Mental health
A link has been found between systemic inflammations and anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses (GI Associate and Endoscopy Center, 2022a). The health of the gut has a large impact on the inflammatory state of the body. It also has a key function in the release of many neurotransmitters, one of which is serotonin, an important mood neurotransmitter.
Huntington’s disease
When the gut microbiota is unbalanced, there is an influence on mood, cognition, and sleep, which are already negatively impacted by this disease (Wasser et al., 2020).
Diseases Known to Be Linked to the Gut-Brain Axis Connection
Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the gut-lung axis has been more recently explored. Overall, the gut’s role in the health of the body’s overall immunity and the reduction of systemic inflammation has been applied to COVID-19 infection. The resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome that is a life-threatening effect of the virus is caused by an autoimmune-response-mediated inflammation in the lungs. Overall rates of mortality with COVID-19 are markedly higher for those admitted to the intensive care unit, and those who have gastrointestinal symptoms in conjunction with their respiratory symptoms are much more likely to need intensive care, making gastrointestinal issues a determinant of prognosis (Chen et al., 2020; Cleveland Clinic, 2022b; Ye et al., 2020; Ouali et al., 2021). Long-haul COVID-19 has also become more prevalent. Because clients who have gastrointestinal symptoms with COVID-19 infection have a longer detoxification time after infection, they are at a higher risk for developing long-haul COVID than those without gastrointestinal symptoms.

Gut-Liver, Gut-Brain, and Gut-Lung Axis
Gut-liver axis communication happens between nutrients, metabolites, microbial antigens, and bile acids within a microbial community (Ding et al., 2020; Tilg et al., 2022).

Because clients who have gastrointestinal symptoms with COVID-19 infection have a longer detoxification time after infection, they are at a higher risk for developing long-haul COVID than those without gastrointestinal symptoms.

The gastrointestinal system contains the upper gastrointestinal system (mouth, teeth, tongue, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum), the lower gastrointestinal system (small intestine, large intestine, rectum, anal canal, and anus), the accessory digestive organs (liver, gallbladder, and pancreas), and the accessory systems (nervous and sensory systems).
While physical assessment of the client is required, the nurse should also obtain a history of the client’s dietary practices, dietary intolerances or allergies, typical eating and bowel patterns, changes in normal eating or bowel patterns, recent unintentional weight loss or gain, and any medical diagnoses or surgical history for proper assessment.
Digestive organs ingest, digest, and absorb the food that is taken into the body to convert it to usable energy.
The body removes all usable nutrients and water from food intake and then eliminates the rest as a waste product, stool.
The nurse’s role is to educate the client on the proper dietary practices that will help maintain gut homeostasis and to evaluate steps the client can take to prevent gut issues when they must take medications that can upset that homeostasis.

By the end of this section you should be able to:
Recognize the normal function of the endocrine system.
Recognize cues of nutritional impact on the endocrine system.
Analyze cues of nutritional impact on the endocrine system.

Normal Function of the Endocrine System
The endocrine system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that regulate and control all processes using hormones. Hormones are secretions that help regulate organ function by exerting their effects on certain cells in the organ. They coordinate biological functions like metabolism, sexual reproduction, blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, growth, development, and sleeping. Related to nutrition, the endocrine system regulates appetite and how nutrients are used.
The hypothalamus is a region in the brain that regulates the endocrine system. The pituitary gland, also located in the brain, regulates other glands like the adrenal, thyroid, and testicles. These glands include the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pineal, and pancreas which play critical roles in regulating calcium levels in the body, metabolism, sexual development, and blood pressure, and insulin production, respectively.  shows the pituitary gland and other key parts of the endocrine system. The goal of regulating hormone levels in the blood is to reach a state of balance or homeostasis. Imbalances can lead to health problems like high blood pressure, changes in mood and behavior, and weight gain (Betts et al., 2022).
These are the primary glands of the endocrine system. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and affecting hormone functions. Overall, a balanced diet with limited ultra-processed food, a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources is important for endocrine health. This diet helps individuals maintain a healthy weight and decrease the risk for hormonal imbalances.  lists the glands that play a key role in secreting and regulating hormones and related nutritional factors.
Gland
Role
Related Nutritional Factors
Adrenal glands
Release cortisol (steroid hormone) commonly referred to as the ""stress hormone""
Adequate protein intake as part of a balanced diet
Hypothalamus
Instructs the pituitary gland when to release hormones
Diet low in ultra-processed foods which decreases inflammation
Ovaries
Produces the female sex hormones including estrogen and progesterone
Balanced diet with limited red meat and poultry
Pancreas
Controls the release of insulin and glucagon, which are involved in regulating blood glucose levels and affecting digestion
Limited added sugar, refined grains, overall calories
Pineal gland
Produces melatonin, which helps regulate sleep
Foods containing melatonin have not yet been found to affect pineal gland function
Pituitary gland
Known as the ""master gland,"" it influences many other endocrine glands, including the thyroid. It affects various bodily functions such as blood pressure, metabolism, and growth.
Limited sodium, diet low in ultra-processed foods which decreases inflammation
Testes
Produces the male sex hormone testosterone
Omega-3 fatty acid supplements
Thyroid
Controls metabolism, heart and digestive function, mood, and muscle and bone development
Adequate iodine intake through iodinated salt, fish, shellfish, dairy, seaweed
Key Endocrine Glands and Their Role in Regulating Hormones (source: Betts et al., 2022; Salas-Huetos A., 2020; Samodien, E. et al., 2019; Tan, D. X. et al., 2018; Xenou, M., & Gourounti, K., 2021. )
Endocrine System
Knowing how the endocrine system works is fundamental to understanding the importance of good nutrition to manage endocrine conditions. Watch this video for an overview of the structure and function of the endocrine system.

Alterations in Endocrine System Function
Endocrine disorders develop in one of two ways. Primary endocrine disorders result from problems with the peripheral glands, while secondary endocrine disorders result when the pituitary gland is either over or under stimulated by the hypothalamus causing an alteration in the peripheral gland’s function. The result of all endocrine disorders is either hyper-functioning or hypo-functioning of the affected gland.
Alterations in Endocrine System Function – Diabetes
The most prevalent endocrine disorder is diabetes mellitus (DM). It is estimated that 37.3 million Americans have diabetes, with approximately 8.5 million cases (23%) undiagnosed (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2023). Diabetes mellitus develops when the body is not able to maintain adequate blood glucose control (Sapra & Bhandari, 2023). Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) typically develops early in life and occurs when insulin producing cells (beta cells) are destroyed in the pancreas resulting in low to non-existent levels of insulin. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results from insulin resistance that develops gradually from obesity and aging. The insufficient amount of insulin (T1DM) and/or functionally ineffective amounts of insulin (T2DM) result in elevated blood glucose levels.
Glycemic control, which is the maintenance of optimal blood glucose levels, is essential to manage potential complications of diabetes effectively. Poorly controlled blood glucose levels lead to vascular and neurological complications including myocardial infarctions, cerebral vascular accidents, renal disease, neuropathies, and retinopathy (Sapra & Bhandari, 2023). These complications result from several different mechanisms triggered by elevated blood glucose levels that either cause buildup within vessels that impede blood flow, reduce the ability of the vessels to autoregulate, or trigger altered biochemical processes that hinder the vessel’s functionality (Brutsaert, 2022). The risk for these conditions developing is increased in clients who have co-morbid conditions.
Differences in Insulin Sensitivity Among Diverse Populations
Members of US racial/ethnic minority groups have higher rates of insulin resistance than non-Hispanic White members of the population. This is most likely attributed to both genetic and lifestyle factors.

Alterations in Endocrine System Function – Other Endocrine Disorders
Other endocrine disorders commonly seen are hypo/hyperthyroidism and adrenal disorders. Hypothyroidism results from the decreased levels of thyroid hormones T4 and T3 resulting usually from autoimmune causes, but it could also occur after radioactive iodine therapy or surgery for hyperthyroidism or goiter (Braunstein, 2022). Hyperthyroidism is caused by increased secretion of T4 and T3 caused by Graves’ disease, goiter, or thyroiditis. Adrenal insufficiency is caused by Addison’s disease or a disorder regulating the pituitary gland and results in low cortisol levels in the body (Grossman, 2022). Conversely, Cushing’s disease/syndrome develops when corticosteroid levels in the body are high either from taking corticosteroid medications or from overproduction by the adrenal glands.

Glycemic control, which is the maintenance of optimal blood glucose levels, is essential to manage potential complications of diabetes effectively. Poorly controlled blood glucose levels lead to vascular and neurological complications including myocardial infarctions, cerebral vascular accidents, renal disease, neuropathies, and retinopathy (Sapra & Bhandari, 2023). These complications result from several different mechanisms triggered by elevated blood glucose levels that either cause buildup within vessels that impede blood flow, reduce the ability of the vessels to autoregulate, or trigger altered biochemical processes that hinder the vessel’s functionality (Brutsaert, 2022). The risk for these conditions developing is increased in clients who have co-morbid conditions.
Differences in Insulin Sensitivity Among Diverse Populations
Members of US racial/ethnic minority groups have higher rates of insulin resistance than non-Hispanic White members of the population. This is most likely attributed to both genetic and lifestyle factors.

Alterations in Endocrine System Function – Other Endocrine Disorders
Other endocrine disorders commonly seen are hypo/hyperthyroidism and adrenal disorders. Hypothyroidism results from the decreased levels of thyroid hormones T4 and T3 resulting usually from autoimmune causes, but it could also occur after radioactive iodine therapy or surgery for hyperthyroidism or goiter (Braunstein, 2022). Hyperthyroidism is caused by increased secretion of T4 and T3 caused by Graves’ disease, goiter, or thyroiditis. Adrenal insufficiency is caused by Addison’s disease or a disorder regulating the pituitary gland and results in low cortisol levels in the body (Grossman, 2022). Conversely, Cushing’s disease/syndrome develops when corticosteroid levels in the body are high either from taking corticosteroid medications or from overproduction by the adrenal glands.

Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Endocrine System
Endocrine disorders can be difficult to diagnose. Frequently these conditions develop over time, and clients present with symptoms that are non-specific. A thorough history and physical is essential.
Health History and Physical Assessment
Taking a client’s health history is the first step when assessing the client’s endocrine system. In addition to general health history questions, it is important to assess a family history of endocrine problems (Bickley et al., 2021). When collecting information on the client’s nutritional status for potential effects on the endocrine system, the nurse should ask about changes in appetite, thirst and fluid intake, and bowel function. It is also important to know if the client has experienced any changes in weight or energy levels.
After obtaining a thorough health history, a physical assessment should be performed to look for signs of endocrine dysfunction.
Inspect the body looking for abnormal hair growth, skin changes, and abnormal body proportions.
Auscultate heart sounds for rate and rhythm as some endocrine disorders cause tachydysrhythmias. Also listen over the carotid arteries and directly over the thyroid gland for any bruits.
Palpate the thyroid gland (), adrenal glands, and testes for tenderness, size, symmetry, and shape, looking for any nodules, enlargement, or changes in texture.
Assess weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) for any changes in body composition.
Assess glucose levels to evaluate glucose metabolism.
Assess sexual development, including secondary sex characteristics, and menstrual cycles.
Evaluate the client’s mood and behavior for any changes (Bickley, et al., 2021).

Analysis of Nutrition and the Endocrine System
The endocrine system requires adequate nutrition to function. Nutritional deficits or imbalances can cause various endocrine abnormalities. For example, the most common cause worldwide for goiter, or an enlarged thyroid (), is iodine deficiency as iodized salt is not consistently used worldwide. However, in the United States, its use has significantly reduced goiter development (Can & Rehman, 2023). Instead, goiter formation in the United States is usually caused by Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves’ disease. Clients who primarily consume other types of salt (kosher, sea, etc.) need to obtain iodine in their diet through other means.
Iodine deficiencies can lead to goiter, an enlarged thyroid. (credit: “Goitre” by Almazi/ Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
A thorough analysis of the client’s nutrition status can help identify potential endocrine-related issues. The nurse should review the nutritional assessment to identify any nutrient-related deficiencies. For example, a client with limited fruit and vegetable consumption is at risk for vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency is associated with multiple health problems. Specifically related to the endocrine system, vitamin C affects the regulation of several important hormones including insulin growth factor and sex steroids (Shi, Rath, & Niedzwiecki, 2021). Conversely, when evaluating the client’s nutrition status, there is potential to find excessive intake of nutrients. For example, a diet with excessive carbohydrate intake can increase blood glucose levels in individuals contributing to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Once nutritional imbalances are identified, the nurse can work with the client to make dietary changes and reduce the risk for developing endocrine disorders (Bickley et al., 2021).  lists signs and symptoms of common endocrine disorders and their corresponding nutritional factors.

Obtaining Adequate Iodine through Diet Sources
Dozens of countries, including the United States, add iodine to table salt. Despite this practice, there are still groups who are at risk for iodine deficiency:
People who do not use iodized salt including people in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe
Pregnant women
Vegans and people who eat few or no dairy products, seafood, and eggs
People living in areas with iodine-deficient soils – primarily mountainous areas (Himalayas, Alps, and Andes regions) or river valleys prone to flooding (South and Southeast Asia)
People who consume foods that interfere with iodine uptake including soy, cassava, and cruciferous vegetables
Alternative sources of dietary iodine for these groups include:
Seaweed (kelp, nori, kombu, and wakame) (traditionally consumed in China, Japan, and Korea)
Fish and other seafood
Dairy products
Fruits and vegetables, although they have a lot of other health benefits, are not a good source of iodine.

Additionally, the nurse should assess the client's dietary habits, including the consumption of ultra-processed foods, as these can contribute to inflammation and disrupt endocrine function. Furthermore, the nurse should inquire about the client's intake of essential nutrients such as iodine, which is crucial for thyroid function, and omega-3 fatty acids, which play a role in hormone production and regulation.

In conclusion, understanding the normal function of the endocrine system, recognizing cues of nutritional impact on the endocrine system, and analyzing these cues are essential for providing comprehensive care to individuals with endocrine disorders. By integrating knowledge of the endocrine system with an understanding of the impact of nutrition, healthcare professionals can effectively assess, diagnose, and manage endocrine-related conditions, ultimately promoting better health outcomes for their clients.","to id excessive nutrient intake suc as igh sdium inte, h can leadt hertesin ndneiely impt  endocrine sste ditional t nrse soul ases elits ditar aits, including e consuin of urarocesse oos ths cn otriue t ination and ir enocrinefntion uerore th nrse shod iire aout the cien intake o esntial nuiens su as iodine, hih is crucial for troid unctn, and omeg ay is, whic a a role in homone rdtio and elation cocusin, uersan  oma untion of te endine sse, cniing ces of nutitional ipact o he edcine se d anling these ue re eenal for providin omprensive are to indials with dine disorers  terati oede of the enorine yse ih an nderstandg of the iac of nutitinealthrofessional an eecel ase diagnose and anae endocinrate onditios, a ooing ett hel com f tei cliets.",21.99121522693997,to excessive can to and the nurse the dietary the of can to and the the of is and and of of the and these are with of with an the of and,6.7761806981519515, endocrine disorders,0.41067761806981523

Planning Nutrition Goals
It is important to set nutritional goals with individuals with endocrine disorders as diet plays a crucial role in managing these conditions and promoting overall health and well-being. Research has shown that dietary modifications can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk for complications associated with various endocrine disorders, particularly diabetes. For example, research has shown that dietary interventions, including reducing simple carbohydrate and added sugar intake and increasing protein and fiber intake, can improve blood glucose control and reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes (Gray & Threkeld, 2019).
The American Diabetes Association (2019) has identified a framework for nutrition therapy goals that reflect the importance of using a holistic approach to working with clients with diabetes. Their broad goals of nutrition therapy are to:
Promote and support healthful eating patterns emphasizing a variety of appropriately portioned nutrient-dense foods.
Consider personal and cultural preferences, health literacy, willingness to change, and access to healthy foods.
Not judge clients about their food choices so that their eating can continue to be enjoyable.
Provide practical tools for developing good eating practices rather than focusing too much on a particular food item or food type.
Clients with diabetes should follow the prescribed diet which typically includes a limited number of calories and carbohydrates. General guidelines for meal planning with diabetes include (CDC, 2023b):
Limiting added sugars and refined grains such as white bread, rice, and pasta
Including more non starchy vegetables
Limiting intake of highly processed foods
Setting nutritional goals for clients with endocrine disorders can be difficult. Endocrine disorders are complex conditions that can seem overwhelming to the client to manage. In addition to considering the nutritional components of the diet the nurse must consider cultural, socioeconomic, and psychological factors affecting food intake. The goal-setting process is only successful if it is collaborative. The nurse should encourage the client to explain how their family, culture, and beliefs influence how and what they eat. These influences should be incorporated into the goals set.
When setting nutritional goals, both short-term and long-term goals are needed. Short-term goals may be necessary to help stabilize and manage acute changes in hormone levels that have occurred. Short-term goals may require more stringent meal planning and food consumption that is not realistically sustainable over time. Long-term goals are necessary to help the client manage their condition on an ongoing basis. Ideally, these goals incorporate the changes needed to stabilize the client’s endocrine health in a realistic and practical manner.  lists common endocrine disorders and related nutritional goals.

Examples of endocrine disorders and abnormal lab values associated with nutrition goals (Brutsaert, 2022; Hoffman & Sullivan, 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022b; Cushing syndrome, 2023; Kiani et al., 2022; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2018b; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2021c; National Institutes of Health, 2023; Xenou & Gourounti, 2021).
Adequate intake of vitamins and minerals is important for the endocrine system as they play a role in hormone synthesis, regulation, and metabolism (Hoffman & Sullivan, 2020; Kiani et al., 2022; Lewis, 2022; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023). These include:
Vitamin D plays an essential role in calcium metabolism, which is critical for bone health. It also plays a role in regulating insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, and deficiency has been linked to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Sources for vitamin D include orange juice and dairy products fortified with vitamin D.
B vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folic acid, and cobalamin, are important for energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Vitamin B is found many foods including leafy green vegetables, enriched grains, and cereals.
Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps protect against oxidative stress and inflammation, which are linked to the development of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Nuts and seeds are a key source of vitamin E.
Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and cell growth and differentiation. It also plays a role in regulating gene expression and hormone synthesis. Vitamin A is found in green, leafy vegetables and dairy products.
Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. It also plays a role in collagen synthesis and wound healing and has been linked to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Fruits and vegetables are important sources of Vitamin C.
Sodium is an important electrolyte that plays a role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. It also plays a role in the regulation of hormone secretion, particularly in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Sodium is readily found in processed foods including snacks, pizza, and sandwiches.
Potassium is an important electrolyte that is involved in muscle contraction and nerve function. It also plays a role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Potassium is also found in leafy green vegetables as well as starchy vegetables.
Calcium is important for bone health and muscle contraction, but it also plays a role in hormone secretion and metabolism. It is involved in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium balance in the body. Dairy products are a primary source of calcium.
Magnesium is important for muscle and nerve function, but it also plays a role in hormone metabolism and signaling. It is involved in the regulation of PTH and insulin secretion, and deficiency has been linked to an increased risk for diabetes. Magnesium is found in whole grains and dark-green leafy vegetables.
Chloride is an important electrolyte that plays a role in fluid balance and the regulation of pH. It is also involved in the production and secretion of gastric acid, which is important for digestion and the absorption of nutrients. It is found in food sources with salt.
Phosphorus is important for bone health and mineralization, and it is a key component of hydroxyapatite, which is the mineral matrix of bones. Several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin, are involved in the regulation of phosphorus metabolism and bone mineralization. Also, involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, and several hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Dairy products and meats are good sources of phosphorus.
Managing Hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia (a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL) must be treated immediately to avoid serious complications. The 15-15 Rule can be used to treat mild hypoglycemia which occurs when blood glucose levels decrease to 55-69 mg/dL. Clients with blood glucose levels in this range should consume 15 grams of carbohydrates and then recheck their blood glucose level after 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until their blood glucose is > 70 mg/dL. Examples of food items that have approximately 15 grams of carbohydrates include:
4 ounces of juice
1 tablespoon of sugar, honey, or syrup
Small portions of candy (hard candy, jellybeans, etc.)
Blood glucose levels that do not respond to these interventions require immediate attention at a health care facility. (source: https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/low-blood-sugar-treatment.html)

Identifying Challenges to Nutritional Goals
Developing and maintaining healthy eating practices can be difficult for any client. For the general population a healthy diet involves eating nutrient-dense foods across all food groups while staying within calorie limits and minimizing intake of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium (Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, 2020). Meeting nutritional goals can be especially challenging for individuals with endocrine disorders as these conditions often require specific dietary modifications to manage these conditions.
For example, individuals with adrenal insufficiency may struggle with electrolyte balance and carbohydrate intake. Individuals with diabetes often struggle with carbohydrate intake and blood glucose management (American Diabetes Association, 2019). Additionally, there are different types of diabetes. Although the nutritional requirements for clients with diabetes are generally the same, clients with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin to regulate their blood glucose levels. Clients with Type 2 diabetes can manage their blood glucose levels through diet. Similarly named, but unrelated to diabetes mellitus is diabetes insipidus. Clients with this condition may be able to decrease urine output by eating a low protein or a low salt diet, but otherwise nutrition does not cause or prevent this condition (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2021).
Following any dietary recommendations depends on more than just understanding them. Clients must also have access and means to obtain and prepare nutritious foods. A client’s culture and norms can also affect dietary behaviors and subsequent health risks (Brown et al., 2022). The nurse should consider the client’s cultural background when recommending food choices. Asking the client about their favorite foods and foods that are typically served at family or community gatherings is one way to learn more about the client’s culture.
A recent study determined that overall diet quality has improved in the United States. However, there are still disparities among socioeconomic groups. These health disparities can stem from lack of access to or means to obtain healthy foods. For example, clients may live in rural or inner-city areas that have few grocery stores and instead must purchase food primarily from convenience stores or fast-food restaurants. Clients with limited incomes may have to choose lesser quality food to ensure they can purchase enough food. Accordingly, differences in diet quality may also explain differences in diabetes health-related outcomes among socioeconomic groups (Orr et al., 2019). The relationship between overnutrition and socioeconomic status is complex, as individuals from lower socioeconomic groups may also develop obesity due to limited access to fresh and nutrient-dense food and easy availability of energy-dense food.
Traditional Foods Project
One example of a population-health based approach to reducing the risk for diabetes is the Traditional Foods Project. This was a 6-year cooperative project involving the CDC and 17 native U.S. tribal programs with the goals of supporting cultural traditions that could decrease the risk for Type 2 diabetes among American Indian and Alaska Native communities (CDC, 2022c). This project demonstrated how to incorporate culture and history into current day health interventions. Brochures with examples of the traditional food stories they documented can be found on their website.
Clients’ lifestyles also must be considered. Inadequate physical activity, poorly managed stress, and inadequate sleep can interfere with healthy eating patterns (Kesari & Noel, 2022). Skipping meals and eating late at night has been linked to hormone imbalances (Gherasim et al., 2020).
Eating disorders, mental illnesses, and unhealthy diet trends can also affect nutritional status and increase the risk for malnutrition. Alcohol and substance use are significant factors that can affect a client’s nutritional status. In addition to the physical damage caused by alcohol or substance use, the consumption of these substances can affect dietary habits. Intake of both can alter client’s appetites and potentially displace the consumption of nutrient-dense food. Frequently, over consumption of alcohol or substances is associated with disrupted, sometimes chaotic lifestyles that can further impact nutritional intake (Mahboub et al., 2021).

When cooking at home she uses kosher or sea salt because she believes these types of salts “are healthier.” Her favorite dishes to prepare are Indian dishes she enjoyed with her family growing up. She is concerned she will no longer be able to enjoy these foods.
Incorporating Cultural Foods into a Diabetes Diet
Clients with diabetes may still be able to incorporate some of their favorite culture-specific foods into their diet. For example, leafy greens including collards, kale, and spinach are a traditional part of African American diets. Eating these foods can help control blood glucose levels. The Latin American staple quinoa is a good source of fiber. Lastly, legumes and lentils, commonly used in African American, Hispanic, and Latin dishes, can also help manage cholesterol and glucose levels.

The nurse should assess the client's overall lifestyle and provide education and support to address these factors. For example, promoting regular physical activity, stress management techniques, and adequate sleep can complement dietary interventions in managing endocrine disorders.

By understanding the complex interplay of these factors, nurses can effectively collaborate with clients to develop realistic and sustainable nutritional goals that promote optimal endocrine wellness and overall health.","and eaeate edocrin disorders he nurse shold asess the clients oal st an pide edco an supo o esstes fctrs. or eaple pootin reulr phsi actiit, stess anemnt tehue, an aeua e can clent diet inteentions n managin enorine disder  onlsion stin ntritial alsor ent th ein isordes reures  iti proa that oers e ef deta odfatons nee to mnage heir conition, s el a the cliet ltural socioeconomc  liestyle atr.  destandin the ope inerla o these fcor urses n eetiel coorate it clint to eel relis and stainal nritionl gols hat pooe oial endocrine elles and overalleath",20.87745839636914,and the and to these and can nutritional for clients with the needed to manage their the and lifestyle of these with to and and,6.313131313131313,s needed to manage their condition,1.5151515151515151

Holistic Nursing Assessment of the Client’s Readiness to Learn
A holistic nutritional evaluation of the client involves assessing not only the client's physical symptoms and medical history, but also their educational, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. Socioeconomic conditions, cultural norms, and religious beliefs affect a person’s nutritional intake and learning ability.
Assessing a client’s readiness to learn involves identifying the client’s strengths and barriers relative to learning as well as their motivation to learn and receptiveness to the instruction. Health literacy is a fundamental consideration when teaching clients. Health literacy refers to how well an individual can find, understand, and use information to make informed health-related decisions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023c). Education goals and strategies should be formulated consistent with the client’s health literacy level.

Client Teaching
Effective education helps clients improve their overall health, manage chronic diseases, and lower the risk for complications (Ardoin, 2022). Teaching clients how to follow their prescribed diet requires time, client engagement, and a variety of resources and strategies (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2023). Once the nurse has assessed the client’s education needs, the nurse needs to work with the client to set learning goals and objectives and select appropriate learning resources (National Library of Medicine, 2021). Client education should be structured around the methods of learning best suited for the client. Examples of educational resources include written materials, models, and videos. Be realistic regarding the amount of content that needs to be covered and respect the client’s limits. Use an organized but flexible approach to be able to adjust to the client’s response. If possible, involve family members or caregivers in the process as these individuals can provide additional support to the client.
The nurse should use cover the following items as part of monitoring carbohydrate intake for clients with diabetes mellitus:
Clients with diabetes should track their carbohydrate intake to better manage their blood glucose levels.
Keeping blood glucose levels stable and as close to normal as possible will help the client feel well and prevent or delay the development of diabetes-related complications.
There are three types of carbohydrates:
Sugars – naturally found in fruit or milk, or added to many foods (added sugars are identified on the food label)
Starches – grains and starchy vegetables such as corn or potatoes
Fiber – indigestible part of plants that do not elevate blood glucose levels
Carbohydrates are measured in grams and listed on food labels or found in resources listing nutritional information for nonpackaged food items.
One serving of carbohydrates = 15 grams of carbohydrates.
The client should follow their prescribed diet indicating how many servings of carbohydrates to consume.
The client should try to consume a consistent amount of carbohydrates at each meal to maintain consistent blood glucose levels. (CDC, 2023a)
The portion sizes of food served by restaurants have increased over time. This can make it difficult for clients to accurately measure food servings and follow their prescribed diet. This video demonstrates how portion sizes can be measured using your hands – no measuring tools required. Watch this video from CHI health on how to use your hand to measure portion sizes.

It is important to educate the client on how to read food labels and understand portion sizes to accurately track their carbohydrate intake. Additionally, the nurse should provide guidance on meal planning, including the selection of healthy carbohydrate sources and the importance of balancing carbohydrates with proteins and fats to optimize endocrine wellness. By providing comprehensive education and support, the nurse can empower the client to make informed decisions about their nutritional intake and effectively manage their condition.",carbohydrate int d true iten troht thea to maintain ste blood glucose levels.   portn o eduat he inread o es an etd or ies to accurately re odrina oll the resrid ie i ide eonath ort ses an e mre ing or hands  no esring oreied at ths eor helt o o o ue ur and t mae tioni.,46.95652173913044,to maintain blood glucose levels. to food and portion sizes on to to,13.978494623655912, blood glucose levels. ,3.225806451612903

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Evaluate a nutritional plan for its effect on endocrine wellness.
Modify a nutritional plan to promote endocrine wellness.

Evaluating the Client’s Compliance with the Meal Plan
It is important to determine how well the client has followed the prescribed diet. Self-monitoring of food intake through a food diary (either paper-based documentation or through an app) is one way to determine this. Diet recalls and food frequency questionnaires are other diet assessment tools that rely upon self-reported data. The nurse should consider that self-kept food records are not always accurate as self-reported food consumption is likely to be misreported in some way (Ravelli & Scholeller, 2020. However, reviewing the food diary with the client is still beneficial because it can encourage discussion and provide an opportunity for additional instruction on food choices and portion control. For clients with diabetes, an additional method of monitoring compliance is maintaining and reviewing home blood glucose checks to determine if they are within the recommended ranges for the client.
Food Journals
Despite potential inaccuracies, it is still helpful to review a client’s food journal as part of their assessment to learn more about dietary patterns, food preferences, and issues. To promote consistency with the journaling task, help the client select the method of journaling that is most feasible for them to use—either a paper journal (notebook, diary, or single pages like the journal sample here developed by the CDC My Food Diary) or electronic method (phone application, spreadsheet, or other software). This will make the process easier for the client and increase the client’s likelihood of following through.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Nutritional Plan
The plan’s effectiveness is evaluated by measuring expected clinical outcomes. If the nutritional plan (meal plan) has been effective, the client should report an improvement in their symptoms. There are objective measures that can be evaluated as well. Clients with endocrine disorders typically have laboratory tests performed regularly to measure the relevant electrolyte and hormone levels. For example, clients with diabetes will have hemoglobin A1C levels drawn that indicate the client’s glucose control over time. Clients with thyroid conditions will have thyroid panel drawn. A thyroid panel is a group of laboratory tests that measure hormones and proteins that indicate thyroid functioning. Noninvasive means of measuring effectiveness include measuring the client’s weight and vital signs to determine if there have been improvements. If the goals were not met, the plan needs to be adjusted. Perhaps the plan was too difficult for the client to follow and involved too many dietary changes all at once. The updated plan could focus on prioritizing and managing fewer nutrients initially and then expanded as the client is able to manage the changes. If the client followed the plan but did not see the expected outcomes, work with the healthcare provider and dietician to adjust the plan.
Assessing Blood Glucose Levels
Measuring blood glucose levels is a routine part of evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment plan for a client with diabetes. When measuring a client’s blood glucose level, either by performing a point of care fingerstick glucose measurement or a venous lab drawn, always note the last time the client ate. This is important to know when interpreting the result as glucose levels fluctuate with meals.
Part C
To improve her endocrine health, the nursing team encourages Meena to engage in regular physical activity and provides education on a balanced diet and portion control. They also refer her to a registered dietitian for personalized nutritional guidance. In addition to these lifestyle changes, Meena is advised to monitor her blood glucose levels regularly to help manage her type 2 diabetes and maintain better glycemic control.
For her hypothyroidism management, the nursing team educates Meena about incorporating iodine-rich foods, such as seafood, dairy products, and iodized salt, into her diet to support thyroid function. Meena is receptive to this but is concerned because her family traditionally has not eaten much meat or seafood. She has eaten some fish, but reports she has a limited grocery budget, and she does not think she can afford to eat it regularly. The team works with Meena to identify budget-conscious ways to incorporate seafood consistent with her cultural practices into her diet. They also collaborate with an endocrinologist to ensure that Sarah receives appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and ongoing monitoring.
Through this comprehensive care plan, Meena is supported in her efforts to improve her endocrine health and overall well-being. The nursing team continues to follow up with Meena and assess her progress, adjusting the care plan as needed.
The endocrine system plays a crucial role in regulating many bodily functions. Accordingly, endocrine disorders can manifest themselves through a wide range of signs and symptoms.
Proper nutrition is essential for its optimal functioning of the endocrine system. Tailored meal plans can at least minimize symptoms if not manage most endocrine diseases.
Assessing client nutrition from a holistic perspective is necessary to address not only physical needs, but psychological, social, and cultural needs as well.
Nutritional strategies should be realistic and manageable for the client to follow.
Evaluation of nutritional interventions is based upon subjective information from the client regarding how well the client is adhering to the diet and symptom improvement as well as laboratory values related to the specific endocrine disorder.

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Recognize cues that indicate the impact of nutrition on the hematological system.
Analyze cues to determine the impact of nutrition on the hematological system.

Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Hematological System
Early recognition of hematologic abnormalities and micronutrient deficiency signs can lead to prompt interventions. Nurses play a key role in assessment, delivery of age-appropriate intervention, and education aimed at restoration and prevention of recurrence. Through a comprehensive client assessment, the nurse can apply the nursing process specific to nutritional practices that impact hematologic function. Considering the client’s nutritional preferences, the nurse can develop strategies to promote hematologic wellness.
Providing holistic care to clients is a core competency for nurses; however, the quality of nutritional assessments and decision-making can be inconsistent due to variations in clinical experience and settings of practice (Lulloff et al., 2019). Delays in diagnosing excessive or deficient nutritional intake can lead to hematologic abnormalities, which can result in life-threatening complications and long-term disease consequences. Accurate assessment of the client’s nutritional status with early intervention gives clients the best chance for recovery.
Nurses who provide continuity and consistency through frequent assessment are well-positioned to recognize subtle changes and to work collaboratively with the healthcare team to develop a plan of care. Assessment of nutritional impact on the hematological system crosses multiple domains of clients’ needs with emphasis on physiological and psychosocial integrity and management of care.
Physiological and Psychosocial Assessment
The nurse should begin the assessment with a health history. The client’s age and sex are important to consider as bone marrow function and immunity decrease with age, and sex influences specific risk factors for hematologic changes (Márquez et al., 2020). The health history includes past medical and surgical history, with emphasis on blood disorders and any past episodes of bleeding, autoimmune disease, and gastrointestinal disease that may result in malabsorption. Surgical history should include the presence of postoperative complications such as poor wound healing and excessive bleeding or bruising. The nurse should explore family medical history because hereditary anemias and certain metabolic conditions can impact hematopoiesis. Also, because many medications have known hematologic side effects, the nurse should obtain an accurate list of the client’s current medications, including over-the-counter products, vitamins, herbs, and nutritional supplements that may provide cues to risk factors when analyzing health data.
The purpose of a nutritional assessment is to identify risk factors and specific nutritional deficiencies, to determine nutritional needs, and to identify the physiological, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors that may affect hematologic function (Serón-Arbeola, 2022). Dietary history, including the client’s eating and drinking habits, could highlight specific nutrient deficiencies; however, obtaining accurate dietary intake is challenging. If time permits, the use of a food diary actively completed by the client is helpful. Behavioral and emotional considerations and social determinants of health also must be explored (Walker-Clarke et al., 2022). Specific themes to discuss include the following:
Access to food
Aversion to specific foods
Mental health influences of eating, such as anxiety and depression
Food preparation knowledge and skill
Time constraints and family meal patterns
Attitudes and beliefs surrounding food consumption.
A physical assessment will include subjective and objective data (), be system-based, and include vital signs and anthropometric measurements, specifically, height, weight, and body mass index. Of particular importance is the amount of weight loss (percentage) experienced over a specific period of time. Rapid, unexpected weight loss of 5 to 10 percent from baseline is a risk factor for systemic manifestations of nutritional deficiencies. Triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) and midarm circumference (MAC) are used with increased frequency to further define nutritional status, particularly in clients with concerns of malnutrition. TSF correlates with fat mass and MAC with protein composition (Serón-Arbeola et al., 2022).

Ask Open-ended Questions
Nurses should always ask clients open-ended questions to elicit a more informative history. For example, the nurse could ask “How often do you eat red meat each month?” instead of “Do you eat red meat?”.

Management of Care: Diagnostic Assessment
Blood analysis is the primary diagnostic method for evaluating concerns of hematologic changes impacted by nutritional deficiencies; however, nutritional screening, often performed by a registered dietician, should be completed first in a comprehensive assessment ().
Some laboratory results can determine the client’s nutritional status. Prealbumin levels can be used to evaluate the client’s protein status. Transferrin is a protein that transports iron through the blood to different tissues and organs and is often measured when iron deficiency is suspected as a cause of anemia. In the evaluation of anemia, complete blood count (CBC), serum iron level, serum vitamin B12, and folate levels should also be checked. Blood tests for specific vitamin deficiencies may be necessary for clients who have gastrointestinal malabsorption (Read et al., 2021; Socha et al., 2020).
When blood results fail to confirm a diagnosis in symptomatic clients, a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy may be necessary to evaluate the production of hematologic stem cells and the bone marrow microenvironment for evidence of malfunction.

Analysis of Nutrition and the Hematologic System
Developing clinical judgment requires the nurse to recognize laboratory abnormalities and associate significance to the client’s history and physical assessment (NCSBN, 2022). Making connections between a client’s diet history—such as lacking red meat, a critically low hemoglobin, and signs and symptoms of anemia—will result in identification of potential complications and anticipation of medical intervention. See .
Among nutritional blood disorders, iron deficiency anemia is the most common with increased prevalence in young children, pregnant women, and older adults (Burton et al., 2020). Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by a low hemoglobin concentration with small (microcytic), pale (hypochromic) red blood cells. The nurse should consider other nutrient-related hematologic disorders as well:

Nursing Considerations
As the client’s relevant information is identified, the nurse will apply the nursing process, determine related nursing diagnoses, and prepare to implement evidence-based care. Potential nursing diagnoses for aiding the client in the restoration of hematologic wellness include the following: (Doenges et.al., 2022)
Imbalanced nutrition, undernutrition
Fatigue, related to malnutrition
Failure to thrive, related to nutritional deficiency
Frail elderly syndrome, related to malnutrition
Knowledge deficit, related to nutrients needed for hematologic wellness
Decreased activity tolerance, related to fatigue
Impaired skin integrity, related to anemia, nutritional deficiency
Impaired memory, related to anemia
Infection, delayed wound healing, related to nutritional deficiency
Impaired gas exchange, related to anemia
Risk for infection, related to nutritional deficiency
Risk for bleeding, related to nutritional deficiency
Risk for falls, related to anemia
Risk for unstable blood pressure, related to anemia
Risk for constipation, after iron supplementation
Risk for ineffective tissue perfusion, related to anemia
Risk for delayed child development, related to nutritional deficiencies
Part A
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.
Grant continues with his assessment of Ms. Foster. She reports difficulty sleeping for the past several months and poor concentration. Over the past three days, she has been short of breath with little exertion and lightheaded. As Grant discusses her diet history and food preferences, Ms. Foster reports that she constantly craves ice; otherwise, her diet consists of bread, chicken, and canned vegetables. While Grant continues to perform his assessment, her primary care physician (PCP) calls to report Ms. Foster’s hemoglobin as 6.2 gm/dL from the morning labs and requests additional diagnostic evaluation to determine the etiology of her severe anemia. Grant recognizes that older adults are at risk for nutritional anemias and suspects this for Ms. Foster. He understands the importance of a thorough history and assessment to avoid potentially life-threatening complications of anemia. Grant has completed his assessment of Ms. Foster and has obtained the following blood samples as ordered by her PCP:
CBC
Serum iron
Ferritin
Folate
Vitamin B12
Her CBC confirms severe microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 6.0 gm/dL with a low mean corpuscle volume). Since Ms. Foster has symptomatic anemia with shortness of breath and lightheadedness, Grant notifies the emergency department physician and requests an additional evaluation. An ECG and chest radiograph are performed; the physician determines that the source of Ms. Foster’s symptoms is unlikely related to hemorrhage and is most likely related to a nutritional deficiency. An order to transfuse one unit of packed red blood cells over two to four hours is received.
Grant recognizes that iron deficiency is the most common cause of nutritional microcytic anemia. He is also aware that the turnaround time for laboratory iron studies is 24 to 48 hours. He updates Ms. Foster and her daughter with the plan of care and determines the priority nursing diagnosis to be impaired gas exchange, related to anemia; imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to iron deficiency.

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Prioritize hypotheses of nutritional habits that optimize hematological wellness.
Generate solutions to optimize hematological wellness utilizing nutritional habits.

Identifying Challenges to Nutritional Goals
Once nutritional deficiencies impacting hematopoiesis have been discovered, the nurse should explore goals aimed at restoration of wellness. Barriers to a client’s success can include physiological and psychosocial factors. Assisting the client in determining which nutritional habits can be modified is challenging but essential at this stage of planning. The nurse should consider both the setting (hospital, clinic, client’s home) and the audience for discussion. Goals that consider cultural influences are more likely to guide the client toward a nutritional lifestyle with a lasting positive impact (Walker-Clarke et al., 2022).
Physiological Factors
Most physical attributes are non-modifiable; however, understanding the impact of physiological factors on nutrition is an important component of client education. Providing anticipatory guidance related to nutrient demands in various stages of life can influence goal setting through the management of expectations. Although clients cannot manipulate their family medical history and genetics, health promotion strategies can be applied using these factors as motivators.
In terms of biological sex, males have higher energy demands than females, as well as an increased trajectory for height and weight compared. Nutritional needs increase during pregnancy because of physiological and hormonal changes and fetal demand. Folate deficiency is common during pregnancy and can lead to serious hematologic deficits in both the mother and fetus (Grzymisławska et.al., 2020).
Neonates and infants have increased caloric and protein needs to support the rapid growth and development that occurs during this time, as well as to prevent anemia and bleeding disorders. Breastfed infants are dependent on the health and diet of their mother. Research has discovered that genetic variations in both the mother and child can affect the production and consumption of milk (Golan, 2020). With this knowledge, nurses can intentionally explore breastfeeding habits and provide support and rationale if nutritional supplementation is indicated.
As humans age, growth hormone and erythropoietin deficiencies occur, which contribute to decreased production of red blood cells. Additionally, appetite and food intake decrease due to delayed gastric emptying and changes in taste. Papillae (taste buds) density decreases in older adults that results in taste and smell alterations. Poor dental health, ill-fitting dentures, and dry mouth further contribute to decreased food intake, leading to nutrient deficiencies. Although energy needs decrease with age, protein and micronutrients requirements increase (Kaur et al., 2019).
Disease comorbidities often result in increased caloric, protein, and micronutrient needs. Acute and long-term illnesses such as trauma, burns, cancer, lung disease, and immune dysfunction require even higher protein and micronutrient intake to restore homeostasis during the healing stage.
Psychosocial Factors
Psychological and social factors impact eating behaviors throughout the lifespan (Walker-Clarke et al., 2022). These are often considered modifiable contributors and are a major target for interventional strategies to restore hematologic wellness (). Assisting clients in recognizing the presence of these factors is the first step—requiring empathy, emotional intelligence, and therapeutic communication. For example, although eating more beef or fresh spinach may help combat iron deficiency in the older adult, financial constraints may prevent this intervention; therefore, the nurse is challenged to create a more realistic economical and culturally sensitive option for the client.

Physiological Factors
Most physical attributes are non-modifiable; however, understanding the impact of physiological factors on nutrition is an important component of client education. Providing anticipatory guidance related to nutrient demands in various stages of life can influence goal setting through the management of expectations. Although clients cannot manipulate their family medical history and genetics, health promotion strategies can be applied using these factors as motivators.
In terms of biological sex, males have higher energy demands than females, as well as an increased trajectory for height and weight compared. Nutritional needs increase during pregnancy because of physiological and hormonal changes and fetal demand. Folate deficiency is common during pregnancy and can lead to serious hematologic deficits in both the mother and fetus (Grzymisławska et.al., 2020).
Neonates and infants have increased caloric and protein needs to support the rapid growth and development that occurs during this time, as well as to prevent anemia and bleeding disorders. Breastfed infants are dependent on the health and diet of their mother. Research has discovered that genetic variations in both the mother and child can affect the production and consumption of milk (Golan, 2020). With this knowledge, nurses can intentionally explore breastfeeding habits and provide support and rationale if nutritional supplementation is indicated.
As humans age, growth hormone and erythropoietin deficiencies occur, which contribute to decreased production of red blood cells. Additionally, appetite and food intake decrease due to delayed gastric emptying and changes in taste. Papillae (taste buds) density decreases in older adults that results in taste and smell alterations. Poor dental health, ill-fitting dentures, and dry mouth further contribute to decreased food intake, leading to nutrient deficiencies.

Planning Nutritional Goals
Understanding clients’ needs requires knowledge regarding their food preferences and choices. Accessing nutrient-rich food lists for the client to review can facilitate a meal plan that is both desirable and feasible. Food preferences often cross physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. Common themes to explore include the following:
Taste and food preferences of the client and their household
Health concerns
Convenience and time
Cultural and religious traditions
Social influences
Physical environment
Economics
Availability and variety
Planning nutritional goals starts with the nurse determining what is reasonable to tackle during the time available and in the current setting, considering both physiological and psychosocial influences. It is important to evaluate the client’s immediate external constraints such as finances, knowledge level, and current well-being. For example, has the client recently received medication with drowsiness as a side effect? Will the client be able to focus on the education to actively participate in goal planning?
Part B
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Part A.
Grant is planning a discharge for Ms. Foster as she completes her blood transfusion. He recognizes that Ms. Foster may be experiencing fatigue or drowsiness from the medical interventions and anxiety and/or fear related to the need for a major modification to her diet. Further, he is aware that the emergency department environment can be distracting to learning. With these factors in mind, Grant determines that he will focus the discharge education on iron replacement therapy, follow-up with her PCP, and referral to a dietician.
He develops the following goal for Ms. Foster’s discharge education: Provide oral and written information on iron replacement therapy including dose, route, frequency, side effects, and administration considerations immediately before discharge. Grant will include a list of food sources rich in iron and inform Ms. Foster that taking her iron supplement with four to six ounces of orange juice can improve iron absorption.
Encouraging Change
To prevent client frustration that can derail nutritional goals, the nurse should anticipate obstacles to the first steps of the plan. After creating a plan to restore hematologic wellness, asking open-ended questions regarding the plan’s steps can proactively help identify solutions to barriers (Hooker et al., 2018). Use of motivational interviewing, increasing knowledge, and assessing readiness for change are the first steps. Ultimately, the client needs to believe that the nutritional change will improve their life. For example, in the case of Ms. Foster, Grant learns that Ms. Foster’s grandson is getting married in three months, and she has been worried about her ability to walk the distance required at the wedding venue. Grant uses this information as an influence of motivation, encouraging her to add iron-rich foods to at least two meals daily, eat meals in the dining room with her friends as much as possible, and use a daily pill container or set a reminder to take her daily iron replacement. Convenient foods containing iron, such as canned or frozen spinach, iron-enriched bread and cereals, and canned white beans, are recommended staples to have on hand. He informs Ms. Foster that with these strategies, she should see a significant improvement in her anemia and energy level within two to three months, just in time to participate in the wedding festivities.

Grant also suggests that Ms. Foster set a goal to walk to the end of the hallway and back before the wedding. By incorporating Ms. Foster’s personal goals and motivations into the nutritional plan, Grant increases the likelihood of her adherence and success. This approach aligns with the principles of patient-centered care, where the patient’s values, preferences, and goals are integrated into the care plan. Grant’s use of motivational interviewing and understanding of Ms. Foster’s personal motivations demonstrates a holistic and individualized approach to nutritional goal setting.

Holistic Nursing Assessment of the Client
Assessing clients for nutritional influences on hematologic wellness must encompass the client and their support circle. The nurse should consider the different realms the client may be impacted by in their nutritional choices (). For example, adolescents, who may be adequately knowledgeable about nutrient-rich food sources, may choose less healthy options at school due to peer influence. The nurse should help clients visualize potentially challenging situations . Visualization of the situation—and how to respond to the situation—can empower clients to improve their attitude and practice of healthy eating and is part of a holistic approach to fostering hematologic wellness (Wiafe et al., 2023).

Age-Specific Considerations
For infants, school-aged children, and adolescents, determining where children spend their time and with whom is an important step in developing a holistic approach to nutritional interventions. The modern family is diverse, and often consists of multigenerational members and different households influencing each other’s health practices. Gaining the confidence of the family unit’s influencer(s) requires a nurse’s thoughtful approach and cultural sensitivity (Barnes et al., 2020). For infants, family traditions regarding the addition of solid food and cow’s milk to the diet can contradict current evidence-based recommendations and can result in nutritional anemias. Discussing menstruation may be taboo for some female adolescents and thus result in undisclosed menorrhagia and secondary iron-deficient anemia. Older adults are often uncomfortable discussing oral health issues and economic burdens that may have led to late recognition of malnutrition. The nurse is in a unique situation to holistically assess clients and their families utilizing active listening and therapeutic communication strategies.

The nurse is in a unique situation to holistically assess clients and their families utilizing active listening and therapeutic communication strategies.

Client Teaching
As the teaching session begins, the nurse should ask the client to describe what they already know about the health concern and should be prepared to adjust their educational plan. If the client reports having nutrient-deficient anemia but does not understand what anemia is, the educational plan should start with an overview of the function of red blood cells and how they are produced in the body. Most clients will struggle with adherence to a nutritional plan (meal plan) if they do not understand why the modification is necessary. This is a component of determining the client’s health literacy. Other variables of health literacy to consider include the following:
Language spoken and read
Cultural considerations regarding whom should be present for the educational session
The learning style of the client and their significant other as applicable
External constraints (time, state of health)
Learning Modalities
Taking advantage of technology and existing reputable resources can be a time saver for both the nurse and the client. Reputable references may be available electronically and/or in writing. Determining access to a computer or internet service is vital if relying on an electronic modality for content. Additionally, consideration of the material in the client’s primary language cannot be overlooked. Potential options include the following:

Evaluating Client Readiness to Follow a Nutritional Plan
Assessing a client’s readiness to change their nutritional lifestyle requires a collaborative conversation. The nurse should emphasize the direct link between iron-deficient anemia, their current eating habits (craving ice and lack of iron-rich foods) and their recent symptoms. Evidence-based research has shown that clients are more likely to engage in healthy behavior if they believe that their symptoms and complications will negatively affect their lifestyle (Lee & Chung, 2021). Often the only motivator prompting change is the presence of unpleasant symptoms. The next step is for the client to reflect on how they feel about change and what they need to be successful. At this point, the focus should shift to providing additional nutritional knowledge, such as specific dietary needs, and establishing the client’s desire to achieve change. The use of a scoring scale can be helpful, asking questions such as
“How important is it to you to make this change, on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being extremely important?”
“How confident are you that you can make this change, on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being extremely confident?”
The nurse must keep in mind that this is not a static process, and the focus must remain on a shared decision-making conversation (National Lipid Association, 2021).
Making Connections
As previously stated, the client who makes connections between food choices and hematologic wellness is more likely to intentionally change nutritional habits. According to the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), change occurs as a series of steps aligned with the client’s degree of motivation (Nakabayashi et al., 2020; Lee & Chung, 2021). This model has been widely used for health education interventions and more recently applied to nutritional interventions, specifically. The model includes five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.  depicts this model, applied to the scenario in this chapter’s unfolding case study.
Transtheoretical Model of Change: Case Study—Ms. Foster (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The nurse’s role is to raise a consciousness that empowers the client to recognize there are more positive outcomes than negative to this nutritional modification. The benefit of using the TTM in practice is its applicability in all settings, adaptability to different nutritional needs, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. (Nakabayashi et al., 2020).
An important assumption to the effectiveness of the TTM is the client’s nutritional health literacy, as it relates to hematological wellness. Clients with low-to-moderate nutritional literacy are likely to have poor self-management skills and communication with healthcare providers (Zhong et al., 2020). Client education targeted at enhancing nutritional knowledge is an important point for nursing intervention. In Ms. Foster’s case, she has identified a lack of knowledge regarding iron-rich foods; therefore, the nurse should incorporate information about iron-rich foods into the decision-making conversations with Ms. Foster.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Nutritional Plan
According to TTM, maintenance of the behavior change takes six months to achieve. In the case of a nutrition-related hematologic disease, the client will need to be evaluated at more frequent intervals due to the serious potential consequences of untreated blood disorders. The nurse should be aware that pharmacologic interventions vary in their onset and duration of action. Correcting long-term nutritional deficiencies is a process. Some medications are dosed according to the extent of the blood abnormality and require intermittent laboratory analysis for dose modifications. For instance, ferrous sulfate has a dose range that is different for infants and children versus adults and is based on the severity of anemia using hemoglobin and symptoms as determinants. It is recommended to check hemoglobin every three weeks during the first month of treatment for potential dose modifications. The nurse should provide anticipatory guidance to the client in terms of frequency of return visits, what will be evaluated at each visit, and what changes or symptoms should the client expect. The client is likely to remain motivated if they can identify signs of improvement, even outside of actual visits with their healthcare team.
Modification of the Nutritional Plan
The final phase of any change plan is to make modifications based on the evaluation outcome, remembering that change is a dynamic, cyclic process. Use of motivational interviewing, with open-ended questions will assist the client in recognizing self-efficacy. Bringing the focus back to hematologic wellness and the potential consequences the client faces if untreated, while praising the successful change, is key. The nurse should re-address the previously established goals and look for opportunities for improvement. In Ms. Foster’s case, the nurse would consider the following questions:
What iron-rich foods have you incorporated into your diet?
How often do you consume each food? What serving size do you consume?
How do you rate your level of fatigue and shortness of breath over the past week, compared with before you started iron replacement three weeks ago?
What barriers do you have to obtaining access to iron supplements and food items?
Part D
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up from Case Study Parts A, B, and C.
After discussing Ms. Foster’s symptoms in relation to her anemia, Grant reviews iron replacement therapy, including the importance of taking iron with a citrus beverage such as orange juice to aid in iron absorption. He informs Ms. Foster that most insurance companies will not cover the cost of iron replacement as it can be purchased over the counter. Grant further offers to search her local pharmacy website to determine the cost and formulations available. He provides a written client education handout on iron deficiency anemia as well as instructions for Ms. Foster to call her PCP for a follow-up appointment in three weeks. Grant then discusses several foods that are iron rich () and helps Ms. Foster identify three food items that she feels she can incorporate into her daily diet. Ms. Foster’s daughter repeats the items needed to initiate this plan and offers to take her mother to the store before returning home. Ms. Foster reminds her daughter that she has groceries delivered every other week but will increase to a weekly delivery to ensure fresh or frozen spinach availability daily. At this point, Grant asks Ms. Foster the following: “How confident are you that you can make this change, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being extremely confident?”

Iron deficiency anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin concentration and microcytic red blood cells, is the most common nutritional blood disorder in young children, pregnant women, and older adults.
Nutrient-related hematologic disorders include vitamin B12 deficiency, Vitamin C, K, and D deficiency, and folate deficiency.
Delays in diagnosing excessive or deficient nutritional intake can lead to hematologic abnormalities resulting in life-threatening conditions. Accurate assessment of the client’s nutritional status with early intervention gives clients the best chance for recovery.
Acute and long-term illnesses such as trauma, burns, cancer, lung disease, and immune dysfunction require even higher protein and micronutrient intake to restore homeostasis during the healing stage.
Aging adults are susceptible to nutrient-deficient blood abnormalities because of decreased production of hormones and red blood cells and a decreased appetite/food intake related to delayed gastric emptying, changes in papillae, and declining oral health.
Use of the TTM for nutrition educational interventions can provide clients a degree of motivation for successful restoration of hematologic wellness.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Recognize cues that indicate the impact of nutrition on the cardiovascular system.
Analyze cues to determine the impact of nutrition on the cardiovascular system.

Normal Function of the Cardiovascular System
The cardiovascular system includes the heart, blood, blood vessels, lymph, lymphatic vessels, and glands that move blood and lymph through the body. Assessment of this system involves the mechanical and electrical functions of the heart and blood vessels and their effectiveness at circulating blood throughout the body. Assessment should also include an examination of a client’s nutritional status.
The cardiovascular system’s primary role is to circulate blood throughout the body. The components of this system include the heart, known as the cardiac muscle, and blood vessels. The blood vessels include the arteries, which carry oxygenated blood from the heart to other parts of the body; veins, which carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart; and capillaries, tiny blood vessels with thin walls where arteries and veins exchange blood supply.
The heart has two components—the electrical conduction system and the mechanical working component—that work together to effectively pump blood and maintain proper perfusion, or movement of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to tissues in the body. The electrical system sends an impulse to the excitable cardiac tissue cells and triggers them to mechanically contract in a specific pattern to push blood throughout the body.
Nutrition can heavily impact the heart’s ability to complete the task of pumping blood. Like other muscles in the body, the heart requires electrolytes to produce action-potential impulses in muscles. The electrical charge that sends an impulse to the heart to trigger contraction is highly dependent on the involuntary process of potassium and sodium ion exchange (Balchem, 2021). Likewise, muscles, including the heart, are dependent on calcium and magnesium ion exchange for physical contraction or movement (Balchem, 2021). Low levels of these electrolytes can result in dysrhythmias and ineffective cardiac output and perfusion.
For the mechanical working component of the heart to function properly, the cardiac muscle must be supplied with oxygen and nutrients from the coronary arteries. The cardiac muscle must also be in good physical working condition and able to receive impulses from the heart’s electrical conduction system. The mechanical working component is not necessary for the electrical conduction system to function; but, without the mechanical working component, no blood is pumped through the body—and if the electrical conduction system is functioning independently, there will only be pulseless electrical activity (PEA), or electrical conduction throughout the heart without physical movement of the heart muscle.
Another consideration is the vascular portion of the cardiovascular system. While the heart requires electrolytes to create electrical impulses to trigger contractions strong enough to circulate blood throughout the body, it may still be unable to adequately perfuse the body if the vessels are blocked or become hardened, as in arteriosclerosis. The primary cause of this disease is a nutritional intake high in unhealthy fats and cholesterol. When low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol levels are chronically high, fatty deposits known as plaques form in artery walls and reduce blood flow through that vessel (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 2023). When the heart is forced to push against the increased pressure from the less-elastic and smaller diameter of the diseased vessels, it causes the heart muscle to continually be overworked. The heart muscle can become damaged, and the eventual result can be heart failure.
The other consideration in normal function of the heart is the pressure it exerts against the vessel walls when contracting and relaxing, known as blood pressure. When blood pressure is chronically high, the client has an increased risk of heart failure. Blood pressure is largely regulated in the body by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that utilizes fluid and electrolytes, especially sodium (Martyniak and Tomasik, 2022). This system works to change the sodium concentration in the blood to raise or lower blood pressure as needed by the body (Martyniak and Tomasik, 2022). When the concentration of sodium is chronically high due to excessive intake and is not able to be excreted by the kidneys, the RAAS system is unable to adequately control blood pressure.
There are two main circulatory systems of interconnected blood vessels that flow through the body: the systemic circulatory system and the pulmonary circulatory system. The systemic system provides blood to the body’s tissues, organs, and cells, and the pulmonary system transports blood between the heart and lungs allowing for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange to occur (Sherrell, 2021).
Through the circulation of blood, the cardiovascular system performs several other functions. Blood is considered a “fluid connective tissue” (Visible Body, 2023), and it supports, protects, and gives structure to the blood vessels. Blood provides numerous other functions, including:
Clotting for tissue repair
Protection from infection
Transportation of body wastes to the kidneys for excretion 
Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between body tissues
Regulating body temperature
Transporting nutrients and hormones throughout the body for use and functional regulation (American Society of Hematology, 2023)

Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Cardiovascular System
A thorough assessment of the nutritional status of a client’s cardiovascular system involves examining each component. Many diseases are associated with a lack of nutrition. The most effective method of determining whether nutrition is a contributing factor is to evaluate each component individually. Note that the electrical conduction system and the mechanical working component should be assessed separately.
Assessing Electrical Conduction System of the Heart
The normal electrical pattern of the heart () starts with the initiation of an impulse at the sinoatrial node (SA node), the pacemaker of the heart. The impulse then travels through the atria, the top two heart chambers, causing atrial contraction, down to the atrioventricular node (AV node), an electrical gatekeeper that controls a delay between the atrial and ventricular impulse, allowing blood to fill the ventricle. From the AV node, the impulse travels to the bundle of His, a bundle of conducting fibers that branch to each ventricle, then down both bundle branches to the Purkinjean fibers, or terminal-conducting fibers in the ventricles. This action causes the ventricles, or bottom chambers of the heart, to contract (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023b).
The heart muscle and systemic circulation are vital components that work together to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body’s tissues and organs while removing waste products.

An electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) or telemetry can be used to evaluate the electrical conduction of the heart. An ECG is a recording of a heart’s electrical activity through electrodes placed on the chest to capture signals. Telemetry is the continual measurement of a heart’s ECG through a portable device that automatically transmits the reading to a monitor.
A nurse should know several important measurement facts of a telemetry wave ():
Each small square on the telemetry strip is worth 0.04 seconds.
Each strip should be 6 seconds long.
Each portion of the wave indicates a different part of the cardiac polarization (relaxation) and depolarization (contraction) cycle.
Each wave is expected to have a certain appearance or shape and specific deflection: positive being upward and negative being downward.
Nurses are expected to be able to measure and interpret the points of a telemetry wave. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
For the heart to be in optimal health, the electrical conductivity should be a normal sinus rhythm (NSR). An NSR is a rhythm that originates from the sinus node and is characteristic of a healthy heart’s cardiac rhythm. With an NSR, the wave tracing should be within normal measurements, and the deflections and appearances or shapes of all wave components should have a pulse that is calculated between 60 and 100 beats per minute. In addition, the waves should be consistent and resemble each other.  outlines the telemetry wave components, normal measurement, existence in the cardiac cycle, and the expected shape and deflection.

There are certain telemetry changes in which nutritional issues and electrolyte abnormalities are often the primary cause. Common examples include:
Long QT syndrome—when the QT interval is greater than 0.47 seconds in males and 0.48 seconds in females. This can lead to life-threatening dysrhythmias and can be caused by low levels of potassium, magnesium, or calcium.
Torsade’s de pointes—a life-threatening dysrhythmia known as a multifocal ventricular tachycardia, caused by low levels of magnesium (Cohagan & Brandis, 2022).
A peaked or mountain T wave illustrates hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in the blood) (Bord, 2022).
Assessing the Mechanical Working Component of the Heart and the Blood Vessels
A healthy heart represents the flow of an adequate blood supply, proper stimulation through the electrical system, and effectiveness at physically pumping blood through the body. Normal blood flow through the heart starts when deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart from the body via the superior vena cava. It travels through the right atrium, through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle. The blood is then pumped through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery to be re-oxygenated in the lungs (). Once the blood has gone through the exchanges needed and is oxygenated, it returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. It will then travel through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, through the aortic valve into the aorta, and out to the body for use (Pediatric Heart Specialists, 2023).

The oxygenated blood is returned to the body through two types of arteries. Elastic arteries are located closer to the heart and are more flexible than muscular arteries. Muscular arteries contain smoother muscle and are farther away from the heart. Both types of arteries must have strong walls, because arteries handle higher pressures from the blood being pumped out of the heart (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b). The main function of arteries is to distribute the oxygenated blood to all body organs and tissues, including the heart itself, through the coronary arteries. Refer to  for a visual of the artery wall.
The walls of elastic and muscular arteries must be both strong and flexible to properly handle high-pressure blood flow. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
As blood travels through the body via the arteries, the arteries get smaller in diameter until they terminate into arterioles, the smallest arteries. These arterioles link with capillaries and then connect to venules, the smallest veins (Gupta and Shea, 2022). Capillaries are thin-walled vessels that connect arterioles and venules. As shown in , they are the vehicle for the final exchange of oxygen and nutrients into tissues and wastes into the blood (Gupta & Shea, 2022).

After passing through the capillaries and venules, blood continues into the veins on the way back to the heart. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, because pressures are lower in this portion of the cardiovascular system. Veins also dilate in response to fluid. Some veins, like the large veins in the legs, have valves in them to prevent blood from back flowing (Gupta & Shea, 2022). Once blood has traveled through the veins, it ends up in the heart to start the cycle all over again.
Assessment
The nurse should complete a client’s assessment by recording manual blood pressure and apical pulse (a pulse point on the chest at the apex of the heart). In addition, the nurse should look for other signs and symptoms of adequate perfusion, including:
Quality and rate of peripheral pulses (carotid auscultation and palpation, brachial, radial, ulnar, femoral, popliteal, and pedal)
Skin color check for pallor or cyanosis
Skin temperature for degree of warmth and presence of moisture (Malik & Goyal, 2022)
Skin turgor (elasticity) to check for edema and venous stasis sores or discoloration
Capillary refill, which should be less than 2 seconds
Abnormal findings and their relationship to specific nutritional deficiencies are discussed in the next section.
Part A
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.
Mr. Thompson reports to the provider and nurse that he has had difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and has noticed worrisome leg swelling. He also states that he was told by a nurse at a health fair a month ago that he should have his blood pressure checked, because it was 139/93 mmHg. Today his blood pressure is 126/88 mmHg. The swelling in his legs appears to be dependent edema that is only present when his legs are downward for periods of time and appears to be due to insufficiency of blood return in the lower extremities.
The provider orders an ECG that is done at bedside and shows no abnormalities. The provider also orders a fasting lipid panel (serum cholesterol levels) to help determine the client’s risk for heart disease. Because Mr. Thompson is not fasting, the provider instructs him to return in the morning for a blood draw and to return in one week for follow-up. The provider also explains to Mr. Thompson that erectile dysfunction can be directly related to the decreased blood flow caused by hypertension. The client’s hypertension will have to be managed before the erectile dysfunction can be fully evaluated for cause.

For the heart to be in optimal health, the electrical conductivity should be a normal sinus rhythm (NSR). An NSR is a rhythm that originates from the sinus node and is characteristic of a healthy heart’s cardiac rhythm. With an NSR, the wave tracing should be within normal measurements, and the deflections and appearances or shapes of all wave components should have a pulse that is calculated between 60 and 100 beats per minute. In addition, the waves should be consistent and resemble each other.  outlines the telemetry wave components, normal measurement, existence in the cardiac cycle, and the expected shape and deflection.

There are certain telemetry changes in which nutritional issues and electrolyte abnormalities are often the primary cause. Common examples include:
Long QT syndrome—when the QT interval is greater than 0.47 seconds in males and 0.48 seconds in females. This can lead to life-threatening dysrhythmias and can be caused by low levels of potassium, magnesium, or calcium.
Torsade’s de pointes—a life-threatening dysrhythmia known as a multifocal ventricular tachycardia, caused by low levels of magnesium (Cohagan & Brandis, 2022).
A peaked or mountain T wave illustrates hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in the blood) (Bord, 2022).

Assessing the Mechanical Working Component of the Heart and the Blood Vessels
A healthy heart represents the flow of an adequate blood supply, proper stimulation through the electrical system, and effectiveness at physically pumping blood through the body. Normal blood flow through the heart starts when deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart from the body via the superior vena cava. It travels through the right atrium, through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle. The blood is then pumped through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery to be re-oxygenated in the lungs (). Once the blood has gone through the exchanges needed and is oxygenated, it returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. It will then travel through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, through the aortic valve into the aorta, and out to the body for use (Pediatric Heart Specialists, 2023).

The oxygenated blood is returned to the body through two types of arteries. Elastic arteries are located closer to the heart and are more flexible than muscular arteries. Muscular arteries contain smoother muscle and are farther away from the heart. Both types of arteries must have strong walls, because arteries handle higher pressures from the blood being pumped out of the heart (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b). The main function of arteries is to distribute the oxygenated blood to all body organs and tissues, including the heart itself, through the coronary arteries. Refer to  for a visual of the artery wall.
The walls of elastic and muscular arteries must be both strong and flexible to properly handle high-pressure blood flow. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
As blood travels through the body via the arteries, the arteries get smaller in diameter until they terminate into arterioles, the smallest arteries. These arterioles link with capillaries and then connect to venules, the smallest veins (Gupta and Shea, 2022). Capillaries are thin-walled vessels that connect arterioles and venules. As shown in , they are the vehicle for the final exchange of oxygen and nutrients into tissues and wastes into the blood (Gupta & Shea, 2022).

After passing through the capillaries and venules, blood continues into the veins on the way back to the heart. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, because pressures are lower in this portion of the cardiovascular system. Veins also dilate in response to fluid. Some veins, like the large veins in the legs, have valves in them to prevent blood from back flowing (Gupta & Shea, 2022). Once blood has traveled through the veins, it ends up in the heart to start the cycle all over again.

Assessment
The nurse should complete a client’s assessment by recording manual blood pressure and apical pulse (a pulse point on the chest at the apex of the heart). In addition, the nurse should look for other signs and symptoms of adequate perfusion, including:
Quality and rate of peripheral pulses (carotid auscultation and palpation, brachial, radial, ulnar, femoral, popliteal, and pedal)
Skin color check for pallor or cyanosis
Skin temperature for degree of warmth and presence of moisture (Malik & Goyal, 2022)
Skin turgor (elasticity) to check for edema and venous stasis sores or discoloration
Capillary refill, which should be less than 2 seconds
Abnormal findings and their relationship to specific nutritional deficiencies are discussed in the next section.
Part A
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.
Mr. Thompson reports to the provider and nurse that he has had difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and has noticed worrisome leg swelling. He also states that he was told by a nurse at a health fair a month ago that he should have his blood pressure checked, because it was 139/93 mmHg. Today his blood pressure is 126/88 mmHg. The swelling in his legs appears to be dependent edema that is only present when his legs are downward for periods of time and appears to be due to insufficiency of blood return in the lower extremities.
The provider orders an ECG that is done at bedside and shows no abnormalities. The provider also orders a fasting lipid panel (serum cholesterol levels) to help determine the client’s risk for heart disease. Because Mr. Thompson is not fasting, the provider instructs him to return in the morning for a blood draw and to return in one week for follow-up. The provider also explains to Mr. Thompson that erectile dysfunction can be directly related to the decreased blood flow caused by hypertension. The client’s hypertension will have to be managed before the erectile dysfunction can be fully evaluated for cause.

Analysis of Nutrition and the Cardiovascular System
A client’s nutritional status and needs can be identified with a physical assessment and lab results. Potassium, cholesterol, and sodium levels can be monitored to best track nutritional needs for cardiovascular health.
Nutritional Analysis and the Impact on the Cardiovascular System
Nutritional issues can lead to changes in the electrical conduction of the heart. As a result, the client’s telemetry rhythm can become abnormal. Rhythm changes include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, T-wave abnormalities, ST segment changes related to AMI, U-wave presence or prominence, torsade de pointes, prolonged QT interval, and supraventricular tachycardia. Rhythm changes can relate to one or more deficiencies. See  for a list of telemetry changes, the nutritional relation, and client symptoms.

The presence of difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection, along with leg swelling and elevated blood pressure, suggests potential cardiovascular issues. The provider's decision to order an ECG and a fasting lipid panel reflects a comprehensive approach to evaluating Mr. Thompson's cardiovascular health.

The impact of nutrition on the cardiovascular system is significant, as evidenced by the potential relationship between Mr. Thompson's symptoms and his nutritional status. Monitoring potassium, cholesterol, and sodium levels can provide valuable information about his nutritional needs for cardiovascular health. Nutritional deficiencies can lead to changes in the electrical conduction of the heart, resulting in abnormal telemetry rhythms and potential symptoms such as palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

For example, atrial fibrillation or flutter can be related to excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, high cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure. Torsade de pointes, a life-threatening dysrhythmia, can be primarily related to magnesium deficiency, and supraventricular tachycardia can be associated with excessive caffeine or alcohol intake and heart disease. Additionally, T-wave changes, U-wave presence or prominence, and ST segment changes can all have nutritional relations and corresponding symptomology.

Overall, a thorough analysis of Mr. Thompson's nutritional status and its impact on his cardiovascular system is essential for developing an effective management plan to address his symptoms and promote cardiovascular health.","heaessen o r hmso sos and  rls can prie alale ht nt his caascla healnd ntral as e peenc fiiltin and aintaiin a rtion, aon th e selin an elevatd bl resure sests otntial aiovaar iues he roies eon to orer an  and a in lii anel elets a oreenive c  evalutin r omp cardiovascular heate impat of nrtion on h cardiovascular sstem  niin, a eene by te otentia reatishi eter omss sptm and hi ntritial taus ntorin ptai clestrol, and odim leels can roie aluae infrmaion aot hs rtional need or ardiovascular ealt Nutritional deicinies can lead to changes in the electrical conduction of the heart result in telemetry rhythm an oenal ytm chas aliation, lteaeness chest pin, atie, and shrtnes  reat.or eae, trial rlation  ltter ane relate to excessive caffeine or alcohol intake igh cholesterol levels igh blood pressure osade e pinte a fethreein rymi can be rimiy related to magnesium deficiency, and supraventricular tachycardia can e assoiate ith ecessie afeine  ach ntae and heart disease dditional Twave change U-wave presence or prominence n ST segment changes can al hae nutritional relations and correspondin ymptomolgverall, a thorough analsis o Mr. osons nutritional status andis impat on his cardiovascular sstem is essentil or deloping an eectie manaement lan to addres his symtoms and proote cardiovascular ealt",20.421545667447308,and can and of and cardiovascular and a cardiovascular impact of on the is the and and for Nutritional can lead to changes in the electrical conduction of the telemetry atrial or can to caffeine or alcohol cholesterol blood Torsade de be related to magnesium and tachycardia caffeine or alcohol intake and heart or and ST can and a of nutritional and impact on is for and,7.427937915742794,es can lead to changes in the electrical conduction of the heart,1.3303769401330376

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Prioritize hypotheses of nutritional habits that optimize cardiovascular wellness.
Generate solutions to optimize cardiovascular wellness through nutritional habits.

Planning Nutritional Goals
Several body metrics can help the nurse evaluate the potential for cardiovascular disease development or to determine level of cardiovascular disease present. These metrics include food intake, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, and cholesterol. The primary goal is to utilize the best nutritional practices to prevent cardiovascular disease. If disease is present, nutrition is used to help control the condition and prevent worsening and exacerbation periods.
Preventative Care Nutritional Planning
Preventative nutritional planning should focus on a client who does not yet have cardiovascular disease. Prevention is always the highest priority for clients with a known risk of cardiovascular disease but should also be routine education for all clients, as it affects a large portion of the population. Planning for disease prevention includes monitoring weight and BMI, cholesterol levels, waist circumference, and intake of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, fluid, and fiber. The normal measurements and ranges for cholesterol, BMI, and waist circumference are included in the secondary care nutritional section that follows.
When educating the client on proper nutritional practices to reduce the risks of developing cardiovascular disease, the client must first understand how to properly manage cholesterol levels and the differences in the types of fats they ingest in relation to these levels. Three main types of fat are most often discussed in relation to cardiovascular disease and its prevention—unsaturated fats, saturated fats, and trans fats, which are a form of unsaturated fat. Saturated fats and trans fats are in semi-solid form at room temperature. Like all fats, they are made up of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, but they have more hydrogen molecules than other forms of fat (Moll, 2022). Saturated fats and trans fats are more likely to form deposits inside arteries and harden as plaques, making them forms of fat that the client should limit to less than 6% of their daily intake (Moll, 2022). High intake of saturated and trans fats can increase the client’s levels of low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol levels (Moll, 2022). This is typically referred to as “bad” cholesterol in the body, as it is the type most likely to deposit and stick to artery walls. While not all LDL is harmful and plaque forming, it still puts the client at higher risk when they consistently have higher LDL levels. High-density lipid (HDL) cholesterol is referred to as “good” cholesterol because of its low risk of plaque depositing. Unsaturated fats should make up the majority of the daily recommended 20%-35% of daily fat intake (Moll, 2022).
Maintaining adequate fiber intake will help to prevent cardiovascular disease. Fiber has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and create satiety (a feeling of fullness) to help in weight loss (Harvard Health Publishing, 2020). When increasing fiber intake, it important to also increase fluid intake, particularly water intake, to prevent constipation. Adequate fluid intake (particularly water) of at least 6 to 8 cups per day for women and 8 to 12 cups per day for men is needed for many body processes, including proper blood vessel function, blood circulation, effective cardiac pumping, and sodium level maintenance, which can help prevent heart disease risk if maintained at 142 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) and below (Dmitrieva, Liu, Wu, & Boehm, 2022; National Institutes of Health, 2022).
Another important piece of education for the client is the proper regulation of their daily sodium intake. Too much daily intake can increase the risk of hypertension, which can lead to heart failure. Americans consume an average of 3,400 mg per day of sodium, which is well above the recommended limit of 2,300 mg daily for those without heart disease (American Heart Association, 2023). This maximum is still not optimal as the AHA recommends that clients without heart disease move toward a limit of 1,500 mg daily and those with heart disease to 1,000 mg daily. While this is the current recommendation, there is some debate from new findings by the American College of Cardiology (2023) that individuals with heart disease do not benefit from limiting their sodium any more than those without heart disease.
The nurse should have a nutrition education discussion with the client that includes maintaining a proper diet for healthy BMI, waist circumference, calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels. The nurse can discuss both the use of the MyPlate and DASH diets to accomplish this. The nurse should keep in mind, however, that a fine balance must be maintained between potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium for proper conduction and mechanic pumping of the heart to take place. Most clients can maintain these three electrolytes through balanced nutrition, but if they are deficient in any of these and are unable to regulate them through nutritional intake alone, supplementation should be considered. The nurse should discuss types of foods the client should include and limit in their diet for cardiovascular health ().

Secondary Care Nutritional Planning
Two main diets have been shown to benefit clients with heart disease: the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet. The intent of these diets is to control weight and reduce cholesterol levels and hypertension. This approach needs to be balanced with the client’s need for protein, because malnourishment and heart failure can lead to hypoalbuminemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough albumin, a protein that keeps fluids in blood vessels.
The nurse should consider BMI, which is calculated as weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m2) and waist size values:
BMI—A healthy BMI is 18-24.9 kg/m2;; an overweight BMI is 25-29.9 kg/m2; and obesity is a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher.
Waist size—A person who has a large waist size has a higher chance of developing cardiovascular disease, even with a normal BMI. Men should aim to keep their waist size below 40 inches (102 cm) and women should aim to keep their waist size below 35 inches (88 cm) (Harvard University, 2023).
BMI Measurement
The nurse should know a client’s BMI before creating a nutritional plan because a high BMI increases cardiovascular risks. For clients with a high BMI, weight loss should be included in the plan. Harvard Medical School provides a useful BMI calculator.
Another metric is blood pressure, which measures hypertension or the advancement of hypertension. Hypertension is known as the silent killer, because many people often do not have symptoms. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. A single high hypertension value may not indicate an issue, but two or more consecutive high readings is considered hypertension (Mayo Clinic, 2023c). Blood pressure ranges and their associated condition are listed in .

Cholesterol levels are also critical. Excessive cholesterol levels can lead to the buildup of plaques along blood vessels, resulting in restricted blood flow and leading to hypertension, peripheral vascular and artery disease, and cardiomyopathies, and can cause embolizing events in the body.  outlines ranges of cholesterol measurements and their meanings (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023a).

Part B
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Part A.
Mr. Thompson has returned for his one-week follow-up. His cholesterol values are:
Total cholesterol: 269 mg/dL
LDL: 139 mg/dL
HDL: 130 mg/dL
His blood pressure is 133/87 mmHg, and his weight has increased by 2 pounds. The nurse calculates his BMI to be 21 kg/m2 and his waist size is 42 inches.
The nurse discusses the dietary choices that Mr. Thompson can recall eating in the last few days and discovers that he is not eating a heart-healthy diet. The nurse makes suggestions for other food choices, and the provider refers Mr. Thompson to a dietitian for further education and nutritional management. He is asked to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months. At that time, the provider will determine if these changes have been effective enough or if medications will need to be added to his treatment plan.

Preventative Care Nutritional Planning
Preventative nutritional planning should focus on a client who does not yet have cardiovascular disease. Prevention is always the highest priority for clients with a known risk of cardiovascular disease but should also be routine education for all clients, as it affects a large portion of the population. Planning for disease prevention includes monitoring weight and BMI, cholesterol levels, waist circumference, and intake of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, fluid, and fiber. The normal measurements and ranges for cholesterol, BMI, and waist circumference are included in the secondary care nutritional section that follows.
When educating the client on proper nutritional practices to reduce the risks of developing cardiovascular disease, the client must first understand how to properly manage cholesterol levels and the differences in the types of fats they ingest in relation to these levels. Three main types of fat are most often discussed in relation to cardiovascular disease and its prevention—unsaturated fats, saturated fats, and trans fats, which are a form of unsaturated fat. Saturated fats and trans fats are in semi-solid form at room temperature. Like all fats, they are made up of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, but they have more hydrogen molecules than other forms of fat (Moll, 2022). Saturated fats and trans fats are more likely to form deposits inside arteries and harden as plaques, making them forms of fat that the client should limit to less than 6% of their daily intake (Moll, 2022). High intake of saturated and trans fats can increase the client’s levels of low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol levels (Moll, 2022). This is typically referred to as “bad” cholesterol in the body, as it is the type most likely to deposit and stick to artery walls. While not all LDL is harmful and plaque forming, it still puts the client at higher risk when they consistently have higher LDL levels. High-density lipid (HDL) cholesterol is referred to as “good” cholesterol because of its low risk of plaque depositing. Unsaturated fats should make up the majority of the daily recommended 20%-35% of daily fat intake (Moll, 2022).
Maintaining adequate fiber intake will help to prevent cardiovascular disease. Fiber has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and create satiety (a feeling of fullness) to help in weight loss (Harvard Health Publishing, 2020). When increasing fiber intake, it important to also increase fluid intake, particularly water intake, to prevent constipation. Adequate fluid intake (particularly water) of at least 6 to 8 cups per day for women and 8 to 12 cups per day for men is needed for many body processes, including proper blood vessel function, blood circulation, effective cardiac pumping, and sodium level maintenance, which can help prevent heart disease risk if maintained at 142 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) and below (Dmitrieva, Liu, Wu, & Boehm, 2022; National Institutes of Health, 2022).
Another important piece of education for the client is the proper regulation of their daily sodium intake. Too much daily intake can increase the risk of hypertension, which can lead to heart failure. Americans consume an average of 3,400 mg per day of sodium, which is well above the recommended limit of 2,300 mg daily for those without heart disease (American Heart Association, 2023). This maximum is still not optimal as the AHA recommends that clients without heart disease move toward a limit of 1,500 mg daily and those with heart disease to 1,000 mg daily. While this is the current recommendation, there is some debate from new findings by the American College of Cardiology (2023) that individuals with heart disease do not benefit from limiting their sodium any more than those without heart disease.
The nurse should have a nutrition education discussion with the client that includes maintaining a proper diet for healthy BMI, waist circumference, calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels. The nurse can discuss both the use of the MyPlate and DASH diets to accomplish this. The nurse should keep in mind, however, that a fine balance must be maintained between potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium for proper conduction and mechanic pumping of the heart to take place. Most clients can maintain these three electrolytes through balanced nutrition, but if they are deficient in any of these and are unable to regulate them through nutritional intake alone, supplementation should be considered. The nurse should discuss types of foods the client should include and limit in their diet for cardiovascular health ().

Secondary Care Nutritional Planning
Two main diets have been shown to benefit clients with heart disease: the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet. The intent of these diets is to control weight and reduce cholesterol levels and hypertension. This approach needs to be balanced with the client’s need for protein, because malnourishment and heart failure can lead to hypoalbuminemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough albumin, a protein that keeps fluids in blood vessels.
The nurse should consider BMI, which is calculated as weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m2) and waist size values:

He is asked to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months. At that time, the provider will determine if these changes have been effective enough or if medications will need to be added to his treatment plan.

Identifying Challenges to Nutritional Goals
Motivation, food security, financial resources, disability, and comprehension are additional factors that impact cardiovascular health. Motivation is a significant factor because behavior changes may be needed, and the client may need help maintaining their health plan. For example, the client may need to learn a new diet that includes food they feel is lacking in taste, start exercising, or quit smoking. The client will have to truly desire to make changes.
The second major factor that can impact nutritional goals is access to the foods required in the nutritional plan (meal plan) created for the client. Healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables cost more and do not last as long as processed unhealthy food. This can be difficult for a client who is already financially or geographically challenged. Frozen fruits and vegetables are another potential healthy source that will last longer than fresh varieties, but they are still more expensive. These also require the client to have storage for these that they may not have, depending on their living situation. Canned fruits and vegetables are the least expensive options they could add to their diet, but they are also the least healthy. They may be prepared with large amounts of salt and sugar, and this will outweigh the benefits the client will obtain from eating them. Even low-sodium and low-sugar options are higher in salt and sugar than fresh options are.
A third major factor is the client’s ability to understand the nutritional plan. The client must fully understand what foods are on the diet plan, how to properly read food labels, and how to make appropriate substitutions and measurements. If they do not have a firm understanding, they may struggle to follow the plan. It may be necessary to refer the client to a registered dietician and follow up consistently to ensure the client both understands the education given and is adhering to the recommendations.
Lastly, debilitating health can contribute to the challenge of cardiovascular health. In the later stages of many of diseases, shortness of breath and fatigue can make eating very difficult. It also increases the difficulty level in food preparation, making it easier for a client to revert to eating fast foods in favor of less effort. The registered dietician can offer some solutions regarding food preparation to reduce fatigue, such as purchasing prechopped fruits and vegetables, making sheet-pan meals, and using slow-cooker recipes. This will not alleviate the fatigue that clients with breathing difficulties will have during the act of eating. The registered dietician can take this breathing issue into account and help with the selection of more nutrient-dense foods, so that the client will have to eat less to meet their needed requirements.

In this scenario, Mr. Thompson's cholesterol values, blood pressure, BMI, and waist size indicate potential cardiovascular health risks. His total cholesterol and LDL levels are elevated, while his HDL level is within the optimal range. Additionally, his blood pressure is in the elevated range, and his BMI and waist size suggest a need for dietary and lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risks.

The nurse's actions to discuss Mr. Thompson's dietary choices and refer him to a dietitian for further education and nutritional management are appropriate. The nurse should work with the dietitian to develop a personalized dietary plan that focuses on reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and managing sodium levels. The plan should also aim to achieve a healthy BMI and waist size through weight management and portion control.

During the follow-up appointment, the provider should assess Mr. Thompson's progress and determine if the dietary changes have been effective in improving his cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and weight. If necessary, the provider may consider adding medications to Mr. Thompson's treatment plan to further manage his cardiovascular health risks.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Assess the client for readiness to learn.
Teach nutritional strategies to optimize cardiovascular wellness.

Holistic Nursing Assessment of the Client
An implementation strategy is necessary for success. To solidify plan compliance, the nurse should involve the client in the creation of the plan, ensure that the client has a clear comprehension of the plan, and evaluate the holistic needs of the client.
Maintaining cardiovascular health when no disease is present is also critical. A first step to maintenance is to review diet plans. The MyPlate, DASH, and Mediterranean diets are well known and can be utilized to maintain cardiovascular health. In addition, reducing alcohol consumption, caffeine intake, red meats, saturated and trans fats, processed food consumptions, refined carbohydrates, sugary foods and drinks, and sodium have all been shown to be protective for cardiovascular health (Harvard University, 2023; Morales-Brown, 2020). Likewise, increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, poultry, and using monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils in place of saturated oils will help prevent cardiovascular disease (Harvard University, 2023).
If the client wishes to prescribe to one of the recommended diets, the nurse should educate them on inclusions, exclusions, and reductions ().

Holistic care is critical to heart health and should include a review of other lifestyle habits that can contribute to cardiovascular disease. For example, smoking cessation is extremely important, as nicotine constricts blood vessels and reduces blood flow while increasing blood pressure (Srakocic, 2023).
Physical activity is also paramount when reducing cardiovascular risks. Exercise helps with weight control, BMI, and waistline management, and reduces the risk for diabetes. Regular physical activity can also help manage stress and improve mood (Harvard University, 2023).
Lastly, sleep is a key consideration. Maintaining an adequate sleep schedule contributes to cardiovascular risk reduction. Sleep has been shown to have an impact on factors that relate to cardiovascular health, such as dietary intake, weight, exercise, inflammation, and blood pressure (Harvard University, 2023).

Client Teaching
Teaching a client with cardiovascular disease can be challenging. Symptoms like chronic fatigue, weakness, chest pain, and shortness of breath can make it difficult to motivate the client to learn. For these reasons, the nurse should include caretakers and family members whenever possible during education.
Teaching should include DASH, Mediterranean, and MyPlate diets. The nurse should help the client decide which would be most appropriate for their lifestyle. The nurse may need to adjust the diet to accommodate specific cultural and religious preferences and allergies, and to accommodate other comorbidities that require special dietary considerations.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Evaluate a nutritional plan for its effect on cardiovascular wellness.
Modify a nutritional plan to promote cardiovascular wellness.

Evaluating Client Readiness to Follow a Nutritional Plan
Client readiness is an important metric in their desire to make necessary life and nutritional changes. The nurse needs to work with the client to evaluate their desire to change. Most changes involve significant lifestyle adjustments, and if the client isn’t ready, diet changes alone may not be enough. If the client is willing to follow the nutritional plan, the nurse should educate the client on diet modifications. This will help the client understand how much needs to change and ensure they feel that they can follow the plan.
The nurse also needs to evaluate ableness. The nurse should evaluate the challenges and provide recommendations on how to remove those challenges. The nurse must ensure the client is capable of comprehending the information given to them and that they can make decisions on how best to follow the plan. One step to aid in this evaluation is to ask that the client return with a documented meal plan and include appropriate substitutions for daily meals.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Nutritional Plan
Continual monitoring of lab values and blood pressure is the most effective way to evaluate a nutritional plan. The client’s LDL levels should trend down along with total cholesterol levels, if they were not in normal or optimal ranges. Their blood pressure reading should trend down to a normal level if it was increased. Levels of prealbumin (a protein produced by the liver) should increase to the normal range if they had been low. BMI should trend down if it was high. Overall, all values should slowly trend toward standard levels if the client adheres to the nutritional plan and the plan is effective.
Part C
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Parts A and B.
Mr. Thompson has returned for his three-month follow-up. He claims to be compliant with all the required changes he and the provider and nurse previously discussed, and he said he is feeling great. The nurse documents that his blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, his BMI is 20 kg/m2 (a slight change), and his waist measurement is 38 inches.

The nurse should assess the cardiovascular system, a life-sustaining system in the body containing the heart and blood vessels, by checking both the mechanical (physical) function and the electrical function of the heart, as well as assessing how effectively the vessels allow the movement of blood around the body after it is pumped by the heart.
If the electrical conduction of the heart is not working properly, the mechanical function will not work at all.
The biggest dietary considerations in the health of the cardiovascular system include cholesterol, potassium, trans fats, saturated fats, sugars, magnesium, calcium, and sodium.
Dietary changes need to be implemented with healthy lifestyle changes to see adequate outcomes from nutritional plans.
When evaluating risk factors for cardiovascular disease, BMI, waist size, and blood pressure are major considerations, along with specific comorbidities such as diabetes.
Even those without cardiovascular disease should have a heart-healthy diet.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Recognize the normal function of the renal system.
Recognize cues of nutritional impact on the renal system.
Analyze cues of nutritional impact on the renal system.

Normal Function of the Renal System
The renal system contains the kidneys, urinary bladder, ureters, and urethra () The kidneys (the primary organs in this system) filter blood and remove serum wastes, excrete wastes from the body, maintain blood pressure (National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.), maintain acid-base balance, and balance fluids. The kidneys are also responsible for reabsorption of glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, water, and phosphate, as well as chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium ions (Newman, 2023).
The major organs of the renal system are responsible for regulating the composition and volume of bodily fluids, as well as eliminating waste products from the body. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
There are two kidneys, each located between the twelfth thoracic and third lumbar vertebrae on either side of the vertebral column. The right kidney is slightly lower than the left because of the liver. A fibrous connective tissue known as the renal capsule covers the outermost layer of the kidneys ().
The kidneys filter waste products and excess fluids from the blood, regulate fluid balance, and produce hormones that help control blood pressure and stimulate production of red blood cells. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy & Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Renal Cortex and Medulla
The next layer of the kidney is the renal cortex, followed by the renal medulla. The renal medulla consists of a series of renal pyramids that contain straight tubular structures and blood vessels. The top point of these pyramid-like structures, known as the renal papilla, points toward the innermost layer of the kidney, called the renal pelvis, which is found within the renal sinus. The renal sinus (cavity) collects urine that is produced by the functioning layer of the kidney, the parenchyma (the renal cortex and medulla together). Inside the parenchyma are the nephrons, the basic functioning units of the kidney ().
The nephron filters the blood and produces urine. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Nephrons
Each kidney has roughly one million nephrons (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b, 2023c). A nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and contains two parts: the glomerulus, which is a cluster of capillaries and nerve endings that cluster around its second part, the renal tubule. Urine created in the nephrons will pass into collecting ducts and flow to the minor calyxes, to the major calyxes, into the renal pelvis, and out of the kidney into the ureter.
The kidneys remove three primary wastes: urea, uric acid, and drugs and their metabolites. Urea are wastes from protein breakdown, while uric acid is waste from the breakdown of nucleic acids (Newman, 2023).
Hormone Production
The kidneys also play a role in the production of certain hormones that support other body processes. For example, they help balance blood pressure by retaining water and sodium in the body; they also produce renin that helps to maintain appropriate blood pressure by managing water reabsorption (Merck Manuals, 2023). The kidneys assist with red blood cell production: they create and release erythropoietin, a hormone that signals the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Another hormone, calcitriol, which is a form of vitamin D that helps the body absorb calcium and regulates the parathyroid hormone, is produced by the kidneys. The kidneys also help to raise glucose levels through employing gluconeogenesis—the formation of glucose from precursors—in the renal cortex.
Renal Artery, Renal Vein, and Ureters
Two other important kidney components are the renal artery and the renal vein. The renal artery controls blood flow to the kidneys for both supply to the organ and for filtering purposes. Blood flows through this artery at a rate of 1.2 liters per minute (Dalal, Bruss, & Sehdev, 2022). The renal vein carries filtered blood back to the heart, away from the kidneys.
The ureters are small tubes that run from the renal pelvis to the urinary bladder, allowing for urine passage (National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.). The urine is moved by way of peristalsis, or the involuntary constriction and relaxation of musculature that promotes movement. The layers of the ureters include the fibrous coat (outer layer), the muscular coat (middle layer), and the mucosa (inner layer).
Bladder
The urine that passes down the ureters travels to the urinary bladder, a temporary storage area for urine located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the symphysis pubis. The layers of the bladder include the outer superior surface layer, the parietal peritoneum, and the outer fibrous connective tissue. The detrusor muscle is made up of interwoven smooth muscle fibers that control the contraction of the bladder during urination; the submucosa, which supports the mucous membrane and is composed of connective tissue; and the innermost layer, the mucous membrane, which is composed of transitional epithelium that runs continuous with the ureters.
To prevent backflow of urine into the ureters, small flaps of mucosa cover the opening of the ureters into the bladder and act as valves; the internal urethral sphincter, located at the bottom of the bladder, is controlled by the detrusor muscle to control exit of urine through the urethra.
Urethra
The urethra is a thin-walled, hollow tube-like duct that allows urine to pass from the bladder to the outside of the body. The urine enters the urethra through the internal urethral sphincter; to exit the urethra, it passes through the final controlled muscle, the external urethral sphincter, which is composed of striated muscle fibers. The urethra’s layers include the fibroelastic connective tissue layer (outer layer), smooth muscle layer (middle layer), and epithelial spongy submucosa (inner layer).
Adrenal Gland
Although adrenal glands are not part of the renal system, they are an extremely important accessory gland. One adrenal gland, or suprarenal gland, sits atop each kidney. These glands release a hormone called aldosterone, which helps to balance the blood pH and fluid balance by signaling the excretion of potassium and the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys; aldosterone is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to help manage blood pressure (Merck Manuals, 2023). The other major role adrenal glands play is in the release of cortisol. Cortisol has several uses in the body such as helping to maintain blood pressure, increase glucose levels, reduce inflammation, and control metabolism. The relationship to the kidneys comes into play when cortisol signals the kidneys to reabsorb specific electrolytes and excrete others based on the function it is trying to accomplish in the body at a given time.

Renal Cortex and Medulla
The next layer of the kidney is the renal cortex, followed by the renal medulla. The renal medulla consists of a series of renal pyramids that contain straight tubular structures and blood vessels. The top point of these pyramid-like structures, known as the renal papilla, points toward the innermost layer of the kidney, called the renal pelvis, which is found within the renal sinus.

The layers of the ureters include the fibrous coat (outer layer), the muscular coat (middle layer), and the mucosa (inner layer).

Bladder
The urine that passes down the ureters travels to the urinary bladder, a temporary storage area for urine located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the symphysis pubis. The layers of the bladder include the outer superior surface layer, the parietal peritoneum, and the outer fibrous connective tissue. The detrusor muscle is made up of interwoven smooth muscle fibers that control the contraction of the bladder during urination; the submucosa, which supports the mucous membrane and is composed of connective tissue; and the innermost layer, the mucous membrane, which is composed of transitional epithelium that runs continuous with the ureters.
To prevent backflow of urine into the ureters, small flaps of mucosa cover the opening of the ureters into the bladder and act as valves; the internal urethral sphincter, located at the bottom of the bladder, is controlled by the detrusor muscle to control exit of urine through the urethra.

Urethra
The urethra is a thin-walled, hollow tube-like duct that allows urine to pass from the bladder to the outside of the body. The urine enters the urethra through the internal urethral sphincter; to exit the urethra, it passes through the final controlled muscle, the external urethral sphincter, which is composed of striated muscle fibers. The urethra’s layers include the fibroelastic connective tissue layer (outer layer), smooth muscle layer (middle layer), and epithelial spongy submucosa (inner layer).

Adrenal Gland
Although adrenal glands are not part of the renal system, they are an extremely important accessory gland. One adrenal gland, or suprarenal gland, sits atop each kidney. These glands release a hormone called aldosterone, which helps to balance the blood pH and fluid balance by signaling the excretion of potassium and the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys; aldosterone is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to help manage blood pressure (Merck Manuals, 2023). The other major role adrenal glands play is in the release of cortisol. Cortisol has several uses in the body such as helping to maintain blood pressure, increase glucose levels, reduce inflammation, and control metabolism. The relationship to the kidneys comes into play when cortisol signals the kidneys to reabsorb specific electrolytes and excrete others based on the function it is trying to accomplish in the body at a given time.

Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Renal System
Assessment of the renal system starts with collecting subjective data about urinary symptoms the client is experiencing. Assessing for fluid retention, over- or underproduction of urine, and fluid deficit is useful when assessing renal function. Swelling, unexplained weight gain, difficulty breathing, and very clear urine are some symptoms a client might report that are important to the assessment of the renal system. Additional symptoms might include dysuria (painful or difficult urination) (Urology Care Foundation, 2023), urinary urgency, or urinary frequency. Other information concerning urinary incontinence, passage of urinary stones, color and clarity of urine, retention of urine, and nocturia (nighttime urinary frequency). Objective data collected to validate these subjective findings can include assessment of limb edema, crackles in the lungs, intake and output measurements, and testing of the urine directly.
After collecting subjective data, the nurse should complete a physical examination of the renal system. This can be done through organ evaluation and measurement of function results. The physical assessment of the organs should begin with the abdominal assessment procedure as described in Chapter 4, The Digestive Process with some special considerations to focus on the renal system during this assessment.
The first step is an inspection of the skin, during which the nurse should examine the color and look for masses, bulging areas, or distention. Skin discoloration may indicate anemia, if pale or cyanotic; a bulging area above the symphysis pubis may indicate urinary retention or a full bladder; and distention may indicate fluid build-up. Next, during auscultation of the abdomen, hyperactive bowel sounds can indicate diarrhea, which can result from hyperkalemia (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a), possibly related to renal issues. During palpation of the abdomen, hyperkalemia may manifest as abdominal tenderness; severe skin dryness may mean dehydration; and an overdistended bladder seen through palpation may indicate urinary retention issues. To palpate the right kidney, the nurse should place one hand under the right flank of the client and press downward against the outer edge of the right abdomen to “sandwich” the kidney, which should be smooth and firm (Roscoe, 2022). The left kidney cannot normally be palpated—unless enlarged—due to its location behind the bowel (Roscoe, 2022). Abdominal palpation can also identify urinary retention and a full bladder by identifying fluid in an enlarged bladder. During the final step—percussion of the abdomen—a dullness above the symphysis pubis may indicate bladder distension (Maddukuri, 2022b).
Contraindications for Deep Palpation
Deep palpation is contraindicated in clients with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm, appendicitis, polycystic kidney disease, kidney transplantation history, or a tender spleen, due to a risk for injury to the client and rupture of organs (Roscoe, 2022).
Bladder Scanning
Bladder scanning is another way to evaluate the bladder and its ability to effectively empty. This scan can assist in determining whether a client is retaining urine, indicated by bladder distention and abdominal fullness and discomfort. Post void residual (PVR) volume can be measured with a bladder scan machine, which is a portable, hand-held, non-invasive, ultrasound device. A wand is placed at the suprapubic area for examination immediately after the client voids and attempts to fully empty their bladder (Ballstaedt & Woodbury, 2022). Results help to determine if the bladder is being emptied adequately during micturition, or urination; determine if urine is being produced in those with renal illness; and assess for any bladder tumors, diverticula, or stones that may be present. For young and middle-aged adults (ages 18-65 years), a PVR of less than 50 mL is considered normal, over 200 mL is considered inadequate; for older adults (over age 65), 50 to 100 mL is considered normal; and for children, more than 20 mL is considered abnormal. A PVR over 500 mL, combined with identified neurologic findings, is highly predictive of cauda equina syndrome, a dysfunction affecting the multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots of the cauda equina, which can cause a need to strain or an altered flow or altered awareness of the need to urinate.
Bladder Scanning
Bladder scanning is not suitable on clients who are pregnant, those with uterine prolapse, or those with severe abdominal scarring and abdominal ascites because these conditions may prompt false high results (Ballstaedt & Woodbury, 2022).
Other Body Assessments
In assessing the renal system, the nurse should examine the chest, skin, costovertebral angle (the area on the back flank at the bottom of the 12th rib forming a 90-degree angle to the spine, as shown in (), rectum, groin and genitals, and neurologic system. In examining these areas, the nurse should:
Auscultate the chest for heart and lung sounds (Maddukuri, 2022a).
Examine the skin for color, turgor, and temperature.
Evaluate neurologic indicators such as level of consciousness, orientation, ability to speak and write clearly, and movements of the hands.
Review the costovertebral angle for pain (Maddukuri, 2022b).
Determine if there is any prostate enlargement by completing a rectal examination. (Although the prostate has no relation to the renal system itself as far as function, if it enlarges, it can press against the urethra, preventing urine from exiting the body).
examine the groin and genitals for herniation, deviation from normal anatomy, especially of the urethra, possible signs of infection, and any masses.
Pain or tenderness at the costovertebral angle, the angle formed by the intersection of the 12th rib and the vertebral column on either side of the spine, should be evaluated for pain or tenderness, as it can indicate problems with the kidneys or urinary tract.

Glomerular Filtration Rate, Serum Creatinine, and Blood Urea Nitrogen Tests
In addition to physical assessment, several pertinent tests are used to determine the proper functioning of the renal system and are the true indicators of health. The three major serum tests are the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022; National Kidney Foundation, n.d.). The GFR measures how well the kidneys remove excess fluids and waste products from the blood (factoring in age and sex). This test is related to the 24-hour creatinine clearance test, because it can also identify how well the kidneys filter out wastes. The GFR can be used to evaluate the client for acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as to determine the stage of CKD and when the kidneys have failed completely, requiring transplantation or dialysis. Normal GFR for adults (18–69 years) is above 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; adults (70 years and older) should be greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; and newborn to two years should be 40 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Mitchell, Strafford, & Tavares, 2022; National Kidney Foundation, 2023a).
Serum creatinine is a measurement of the waste product from muscle energy consumption and muscle damage from the kidneys, whereas BUN is a waste product that comes from ingested proteins excreted by the kidneys. Serum creatinine levels should be 0.74 to 1.35 mg/dL for men 19 years and older, 0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL for women 19 years and older, and 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL for children aged 2 to18 years. Normal BUN levels for all ages are 6 to 24 mg/dL.
Urine
Testing urine can indicate how well the renal system maintains fluid balance by measuring hydration status and volume produced. The 24-hour creatinine clearance test measures the amount of creatinine excreted directly into the urine and is conducted through a urine sample collection process completed over 24 hours (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022; National Kidney Foundation, n.d.). If the creatinine clearance amount is low, then the kidneys are not filtering properly. A full urinalysis can test for pH, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, chloride, ammonia, water, ketones, nitrites, blood, glucose, protein, and leukocytes to evaluate for infection and renal damage (Mitchell, Strafford, & Tavares, 2022). Most often, a urine dipstick urine test is used, which can test for blood, urine specific gravity, urine pH, glucose, protein, nitrates, and leukocytes (Mitchell, Strafford, & Tavares, 2022). A more specific dipstick urinalysis test, the albumin dipstick test, checks for microalbuminuria that is caused by smaller protein amounts than the standard urine dipstick test can detect. This test can help identify kidney disease in clients who have a negative test for excess protein in the urine in the regular urinalysis testing but who are at high risk for kidney disease (National Kidney Foundation, n.d.). Another specific urine test is the albumin-to-creatinine-ratio that uses the amount of albumin and creatinine levels to form a ratio, which indicates the level of kidney function.
Image and Biopsy Tests
Imaging tests—such as ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans—and biopsies can also be conducted to monitor the function of the kidneys. An ultrasound image of the kidneys can identify obstructions in the urinary tract and evaluate the size and position of the kidneys. A CT scan of the kidneys can help identify obstructions, structural abnormalities (National Kidney Foundation, n.d.), and kidney disease, which would present as abscesses, masses, cystic masses, blockages, or lesions. A kidney biopsy is conducted by taking a sample of the kidney tissue, usually through CT-guided or ultrasound-guided sharp needle aspiration. The tissue sample is then evaluated under the microscope for irregularities like inflammation, protein deposits, or damage, such as scarring or cancerous anomalies (National Kidney Foundation, 2023b). 
Serum Electrolyte Testing
Serum electrolyte testing monitors fluid balance and electrolyte levels, both of which are regulated by the kidneys. Irregular values can indicate issues with function. The major electrolytes—sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus— are monitored; however, bicarbonate, chloride, and magnesium are also important indicators of kidney function. This list describes the importance of monitoring these nutrients:
Sodium plays a significant role in maintaining fluid and acid-base balance and is primarily regulated by the kidneys. If the kidneys are not functioning properly, sodium values can be impacted (Newman, 2023).
Potassium, primarily regulated by the kidneys, is an important electrolyte to monitor because minor deviations can cause a client to experience life-threatening problems such as cardiac dysrhythmias, also known as an irregular heartbeat.
Calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship—when one is high, the other is low. Calcium is extremely important to body functions and the musculoskeletal system. If calcium levels get too low, bone structure can break down and be life threatening for a client who has renal disease. Although calcium is not excreted through the kidneys, increased phosphorus levels is a common issue in real failure. Phosphorus levels must be restricted to prevent renal failure as well as to prevent low calcium levels.
Although the kidneys regulate bicarbonate levels, they are not as easily attributed to kidney function—other pathologies in the body and compensatory mechanisms can impact these levels.
Chloride is excreted and reabsorbed, along with sodium, from the blood. It is, however, found in higher amounts in interstitial compartments and lymph fluid than in the blood, so monitoring sodium is more important than monitoring chloride for fluid balance because most of these storage areas cannot be measured.
Magnesium plays an important role when renal failure is present because excessive intake can lead to hypermagnesemia and can exacerbate or cause hypocalcemia. Regular functioning kidneys remove excess magnesium, but in the case of failure and an inability to filter, hypocalcemia can become a serious issue leading to renal bone dysplasia, a life-threatening condition in which the body breaks down the bones to increase blood calcium levels by releasing the calcium stored in bones.
COVID-19 and Renal Function
Clients who have a history of COVID-19 infection, particularly severe COVID-19 infection, should be evaluated for renal damage and failure, despite prior history because “30% of clients who are hospitalized with COVID 19 develop AKI” and “more than 50% who are admitted to the intensive care unit with kidney injury require dialysis.” This relationship is still being researched, but several hypotheses are currently being considered:
COVID-19 directly targets renal cells.
The decrease in oxygen from respiratory failure starves and damages the kidneys.
COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm that destroys renal cells.
COVID-19 causes clots that damage the small vessels in the kidneys. (Sperati, 2022)

Bladder Scanning
Bladder scanning is another way to evaluate the bladder and its ability to effectively empty. This scan can assist in determining whether a client is retaining urine, indicated by bladder distention and abdominal fullness and discomfort.

Analysis of Nutrition and the Renal System
Subjective and objective data should be collected, as previously discussed, to evaluate abnormal findings and the possibility of malfunction in the renal system. The nurse should complete an analysis of the client’s nutritional status through the client’s lab values and all assessment findings. A baseline of the renal system should then be established and used to develop a nutritional plan.
When assessing the client, the nurse should ask about dysuria (Urology Care Foundation, 2023), urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, passage of renal stones, color and clarity of urine, retention of urine, and any issues with nocturia. These findings can indicate several pathologies, including cystitis (inflammation of the bladder caused by infection from bacteria). Cystitis is commonly referred to as a urinary tract infection (UTI). Dysuria can also be related to pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract that involves the parenchyma and kidney pelvis. Pyelonephritis is also a UTI, but it is more serious and is usually accompanied by fever, flank pain, nausea and vomiting, hematuria, and suprapubic tenderness, all of which can be subjective data that is also objectively verifiable.
A report of nocturia, oliguria (low urine output), or anuria (absent urine output) with foamy quality urine can be related to CKD. CKD will very often include many other subjective complaints and be verifiable by objective data as well. Other assessment data that could indicate CKD include lethargy, fatigue, headache, breathlessness, edema, symptoms relating to anemia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, cramping muscles, hematuria (blood in the urine), and pruritis (uncomfortable itching). Findings of colicky pain, hematuria, nausea, and vomiting can be an indication of renal lithiasis, or kidney stones. Discharge from the penis or vagina, dysuria, frequency, and purulent drainage from the penis all can be indicative of sexually transmitted infection.
When physical assessment findings indicate potential pathologies in the renal system, testing can assist in diagnosing the issue. GFR will indicate if there is a decrease in the function of the kidneys when the results are less than normal. Serum creatinine should be tested with the BUN results to evaluate kidney function. If the creatinine is high and the BUN is high, kidney functioning is insufficient.  lists laboratory tests typically performed to evaluate possible renal system issues and their relationship to the renal system.

Calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship—when one is high, the other is low. Calcium is extremely important to body functions and the musculoskeletal system. If calcium levels get too low, bone structure can break down and be life threatening for a client who has renal disease. Although calcium is not excreted through the kidneys, increased phosphorus levels is a common issue in real failure. Phosphorus levels must be restricted to prevent renal failure as well as to prevent low calcium levels. Although the kidneys regulate bicarbonate levels, they are not as easily attributed to kidney function—other pathologies in the body and compensatory mechanisms can impact these levels. Chloride is excreted and reabsorbed, along with sodium, from the blood. It is, however, found in higher amounts in interstitial compartments and lymph fluid than in the blood, so monitoring sodium is more important than monitoring chloride for fluid balance because most of these storage areas cannot be measured. Magnesium plays an important role when renal failure is present because excessive intake can lead to hypermagnesemia and can exacerbate or cause hypocalcemia. Regular functioning kidneys remove excess magnesium, but in the case of failure and an inability to filter, hypocalcemia can become a serious issue leading to renal bone dysplasia, a life-threatening condition in which the body breaks down the bones to increase blood calcium levels by releasing the calcium stored in bones. COVID-19 and Renal Function Clients who have a history of COVID-19 infection, particularly severe COVID-19 infection, should be evaluated for renal damage and failure, despite prior history because “30% of clients who are hospitalized with COVID 19 develop AKI” and “more than 50% who are admitted to the intensive care unit with kidney injury require dialysis.” This relationship is still being researched, but several hypotheses are currently being considered: COVID-19 directly targets renal cells. The decrease in oxygen from respiratory failure starves and damages the kidneys. COVID-19 causes a cytokine storm that destroys renal cells. COVID-19 causes clots that damage the small vessels in the kidneys. (Sperati,","function of the kidneys.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Prioritize the hypotheses of nutritional habits that optimize renal wellness.
Generate solutions to optimize renal wellness utilizing nutritional habits.

Planning Nutrition Goals
The nurse should consider a client’s current renal system when planning nutritional goals; therefore, plans will vary accordingly. For the client with healthy kidneys, the goals of nutrition should focus more on dietary needs for comorbidities, including limiting sodium, trans fats, saturated fats, and alcohol; eating appropriate amounts of protein; and maintaining adequate fluid balance.
When creating nutritional plans for clients with compromised kidneys, the nurse should collaborate with a renal dietician and consider all laboratory test values. The plans for these clients should focus on limiting fluid intake, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, trans fat, saturated fats, magnesium, and proteins, while increasing calcium. Note that at the start of dialysis, slightly different restrictions apply.
The Healthy Renal System Goals
The nurse should direct clients with a healthy renal system and no comorbidities to consider nutritional goals for renal wellness. A good starting point is to use the MyPlate portioning method with every meal (de Bellefonds, 2021). In addition, it is important to limit sodium intake to no more than 2,300 mg daily. Because the majority of sodium intake comes from processed foods and not table salt, encourage clients to avoid pre-processed foods or, at minimum, choose no-sodium or low-sodium options.
MyPlate
MyPlate pictorially represents healthy portion sizes of different food groups in a nutritionally sound diet. This tool is useful as a good starting point for any healthy client trying to improve their nutritional intake to maintain health.
Clients should also be aware of protein intake because protein byproducts are filtered through the kidneys. Clients should eat enough protein to maintain overall health, but not consume too much because the kidneys will have to work extra hard.
The nurse should encourage the client to choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lentils, and beans over simple carbohydrates such as sweetened beverages, packaged foods, and desserts (de Bellefonds, 2021). Heart health is important to kidney health, so limiting saturated fats and avoiding artificial trans fat is recommended. The client should consider limiting, or even eliminating, their alcohol intake. Alcohol is a waste product that the kidneys need to filter out, making it less efficient to filter out other things during this time; alcohol is also dehydrating, which affects the kidneys’ ability to regulate the body’s hydration status.
Another factor the nurse should consider is any comorbidities a client has. For example, a client who has a healthy renal system but has hypertension or diabetes is at much higher risk for developing CKD. Dietary goals should include foods that will keep these pathologies under control, as well as include nutrients that support renal health once a client has developed CKD.
Fads for Weight Loss—Dangers to Renal System Health
Diets that promote excessive or reduced intake of specific nutrients, such as protein or carbohydrates, can be dangerous because they limit many nutrients and promote disease. For example, diets with excess red meats and saturated fats may cause heart disease; diets high in protein can lead to intraglomerular hypertension that may cause renal hyperfiltration, glomerular injury, and proteinuria, which could lead to CKD (Gang-Jee, et al., 2020). Well-known diets that require extreme nutritional changes include Atkins, Keto, Dukan, Montignac, Scarsdale, Stillman, and the Zone.
Goals for Clients with CKD
Clients with CKD need to follow the preceding guidelines, but they also have more restrictions. For clients who have CKD and diabetes and/or hypertension, the following restrictions are also required in addition to their original nutritional plan dictated by their comorbidity, categorized by stage .

Identifying Challenges to Nutritional Goals
Many barriers exist for clients with CKD—the more advanced the disease, the higher the likelihood that a client will, either deliberately or accidentally, not follow a nutritional plan. The nutritional plan for clients with CKD restricts fluids, fat, sodium, phosphorus, protein, magnesium, and potassium and increases calcium, which presents many challenges, especially before transplantation. The nurse should counsel the client on the following:
Restricting fluids can be extremely difficult; the kidneys will excrete more urine if unable to concentrate solutes in smaller urine amounts. The client will then become extremely thirsty because they are losing much more water than they are permitted to drink each day.
Sodium and phosphorus are not only found in certain fresh items but are also added to many processed foods as preservatives. Processed foods are much cheaper and more readily available to clients with busy lives, so it is more difficult to avoid these types of foods. Fast foods—prepared foods that are readily available—are not only extremely high in both sodium and phosphorus, but also in fat content. The nurse should counsel the client to limit their fast-food intake to only once or twice a week
The client with CKD also needs to understand how to combine plant protein sources in the right amounts and types to replace proteins easily found in meat. Although lean meat protein sources are acceptable, options tend to be more expensive.
The challenge faced when limiting magnesium is that many food sources high in magnesium are high in plant proteins, which can replace meat proteins, making selections more limited. Another difficult balance to achieve with magnesium is that many high calcium foods that need to be increased are also high in magnesium.
Lastly, potassium is found naturally in a variety of fresh and healthy food choices. Many foods that the client was taught to eat before they had CKD to manage hypertension, diabetes, or any number of other comorbidities, will be ones they now have to avoid due to high potassium content. Potassium is the opposite of most other foods on the list—it is high in fresh food options and low in processed food options.

These barriers include dietary restrictions, loss of appetite, changes in taste, and difficulty chewing or swallowing. Additionally, clients may experience financial constraints that limit their ability to purchase recommended foods. It is important for the nurse to address these challenges and work with the client to find practical solutions. This may involve collaborating with a renal dietician to create personalized meal plans that align with the client's nutritional needs and restrictions while considering their individual preferences and limitations. Furthermore, providing education and support to the client and their family members can help them navigate the complexities of managing their nutritional goals amidst the challenges posed by CKD. By addressing these barriers and providing tailored guidance, the nurse can empower clients to make informed choices and improve their overall nutritional well-being, thereby supporting their renal health.","of anutrition.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Assess the client for readiness to learn.
Teach nutritional strategies to optimize renal wellness.

Holistic Nursing Assessment of the Client
When providing holistic care, the nurse should address potential barriers the client may face in accessing healthy foods. According to the World Health Organization, 30 to 55 percent of health outcomes are influenced by social determinant health disparities such as economic stability, food security, social context, and environment, among others (Reinoso et al., 2022; World Health Organization, 2020). Many of the fresh foods recommended on a customized nutritional plan for renal disease are often more expensive and harder to obtain than packaged or processed foods. To set the client up for success in following the plan, the nurse should inquire about any food security issues the client has. The nurse should create a plan that addresses the client’s insecurities and further support the client by connecting them to the appropriate resources.
Helpful Programs
The nurse should refer clients to one of the multiple government programs available to help with food security issues.

Client Teaching
Client adherence to the nutritional plan may also be difficult if they are lacking education or fail to engage in a plan. If the client does not understand diet restrictions or the need to follow them, they are not likely to follow the prescribed diet. Client and family or caretaker engagement in the planning of their diet and in the active learning process is considered essential to success—engaged clients are more likely to be proactive in the management of their condition and they are more likely to make the needed behavior changes to improve their quality of life (Kariuki, 2022).
The nurse should use multiple educational strategies to increase client confidence and compliance. Educational strategies may include teach-back evaluation of understanding, programmed medication reminders, access to their medical records, easy communication with their provider, and condition-specific educational resources in multiple formats, including digital formats (Kariuki, 2022). The nurse should educate the client on some of the common difficulties they will face when following the nutritional plan and provide specific strategies to address them. The nurse should provide their client with some tips and tricks to help with some of the previously mentioned difficulties .
Electrolyte/Restrictions
Substitutions/Hacks
Fluids
Use small glasses at meals, or do not fill large glasses completely.
Suck on hard, sugar-free candy, such as mints or sour balls, to help lubricate the mouth.
Take sips and not gulps to savor liquids.
Divide fluid intake into manageable amounts for each part of the day.
If going out in the evening, take in less during the day to save intake.
Use alcohol-free mouthwash and perform good oral hygiene.
Potassium
Avoid high-potassium foods.
Use herbs, but not salt substitutes.
Take diuretics or potassium binders when directed by the provider.
Sodium
Use salt substitutions (not salt substitutes) such as garlic or onion
Make sauces, gravies, and snacks at home.
Do food prep and freeze meals instead of buying store-bought microwave meals.
Buy and cook fresh meats, not smoked, cured, luncheon, processed, or jerky meats.
Phosphorus
Use phosphorus binders when prescribed by the provider—take with meals.
Limit foods that are especially high in phosphorus, like dark colas, chocolate, chocolate drinks, cheese, milk, cream soups, ice cream, pudding, regular yogurt, oysters, beef liver, organ meats, sardines, caramels, and processed meats and foods.
Limit any store-bought food that contain phosphorus, phosphate, phosphoric, or pyrophosphate.
Magnesium
Avoid milk of magnesia to treat for heartburn.
Increase fiber intake, as it helps decrease magnesium absorption.
Eat Greek yogurt as a healthy alternative to help lower magnesium levels, increase calcium, and not raise phosphorus.
Exercise to the point of sweating to lower magnesium.
Fat
Avoid trans fats and saturated fat.
Avoid processed foods.
Make food at home.
Remove skin and fat from meat.
Bake foods instead of frying.
Use olive oil or avocado oil for cooking.
Avoid sugary desserts.
Read nutrition labels carefully to choose the least amount of trans fat and saturated fat.
Protein
Limit protein before dialysis—but eat enough to maintain health.
Use plant sources high in protein first, such as quinoa, edamame, lentils, fava beans, chickpeas, pinto beans, lima beans, mung beans, green peas, tofu, pumpkin seeds, soybeans, chia seeds, almond milk, and mycoprotein.
Use animal sources of protein sparingly, and choose lean sources such as skim milk, egg whites, skinless chicken, and fish.
Calcium
Increase calcium; raising calcium will help lower phosphorus levels as well.
Eat foods high in calcium and enriched with calcium; plant sources of calcium are a better option than dairy sources, as dairy also contains higher levels of phosphorus.

By obtaining certifications in nutrition science, nurses can enhance their ability to provide specialized care for clients with preexisting kidney disorders. This advanced training can positively impact client outcomes and contribute to the overall improvement of patient care. As nursing roles continue to expand, nurses should seek opportunities to further develop their expertise and enhance their ability to meet the complex needs of clients with specific health conditions. Advanced nutritional counseling can be a valuable addition to a nurse's skill set, allowing them to provide comprehensive and holistic care to clients with renal health concerns.","to prie adcetitional oneling  btanng erfiations in utrition sne ur an ehnce ther ailito pr eciaie are foliens ih preeitin idy id h d taining cati impact ce ouoe d oni th era impt o patienta As nurs o ou o ea nuro ertiti to urtheve their ptia ee healt t e the co nes o cien with e eal ditios. e nuriioal oela e a valuae ddtion t anses il st, heto ie mese and stae o intit enl health es.",31.923714759535653,to to and to the of As to their the with to and,7.386363636363637, certifications ,0.5681818181818182

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Evaluate a nutritional plan for its effects on renal wellness.
Modify a nutritional plan to promote renal wellness.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Nutritional Plan for Renal Wellness
Evaluation of the effectiveness of a nutritional plan involves evaluation of both client adherence to the plan and the effectiveness of the plan to reach the intended outcomes. Mr. Vasquez’s nutritional plan is considered in the following Unfolding Case Study feature. If the plan is ineffective in any way, the nurse should determine the cause—adherence or general ineffectiveness—so that they can make appropriate changes.
Part B
At the last visit, Jose Vasquez was educated on nutritional changes that will help preserve kidney function and manage comorbidities. At a recent physical examination, the following are noted:
Mr. Vasquez had lost 12 pounds (5.44 kg) since his last visit three months ago.
No edema is present.
Blood pressure: 118/76 mmHg
Pulse: 98 beats per minute 
Respirations: 14 per minute
Temperature: 97.9°F/36.6°C
Oxygen saturation: 97% on room air 
Lungs are clear to auscultation in all fields.
Finger stick glucose level: 100 mg/dL
Mr. Vasquez reports following the nutritional guidelines strictly, and his food diary reflects this to be the case. Lastly, the nurse receives the following lab results from the sample drawn two days ago as a preparation for this visit:

6.2 mEq/L
Sodium1
35–145 mEq/L
122 mEq/L
Phosphorus

5.3 mg/dL

Modifying a Nutritional Plan to Promote Renal Wellness
Unfortunately, renal disease may still progress even when the client follows an appropriate nutritional plan; the client’s nutritional plan may need to be modified.
Part C
It is determined that, despite Mr. Vasquez following the nutritional plan, his condition has worsened. Although this disease process will progress regardless, it is still prudent to address the plan because the client’s disease is now in an advanced stage; the plan requires modifications to prevent further injury.

The renal system comprises the kidneys, urinary bladder, ureters, and urethra, with the kidneys being the primary organs.
The kidneys filter blood and remove serum wastes, balance fluids, maintain blood pressure, maintain acid-base balance, and excrete wastes. The kidneys also reabsorb certain products including glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, water, phosphate, chloride, sodium, magnesium, and potassium ions.
Heart health is important to kidney health, so making sure to limit saturated fats and avoid artificial trans fat is important for both cardiac and renal health.
Depending on the stage of renal disease, the client will have to control their intake of fluids, fats, sodium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and protein.
Clients should engage in the planning of their diet and in an active learning process concerning their health. Engagement is considered an essential pillar for successful health management because barriers to following the nutritional plan are more likely to be identified. Engaged clients are more likely to be proactive and are more likely to make the needed behavioral changes to improve their quality of life.
The nurse should follow the four components of the patient education process—assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation—holistically when providing client education.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section you should be able to:
Describe the impact of nutrition on the renal and urologic systems during pregnancy.
Describe the impact of nutrition on the renal and urologic systems during infancy.
Describe the impact of nutrition on the renal and urologic systems during childhood.
Describe the impact of nutrition on the renal and urologic systems during adolescence.
Describe the impact of nutrition on the renal and urologic systems during adulthood.
Describe the impact of nutrition on the renal and urologic systems during later adulthood.

Pregnancy
Nutrition plays a role in the development and function of every system in the body, including the renal system. This role starts with the in utero development of a person and continues throughout their life. Nutrition combined with lifestyle decisions can interact with normal and pathologic processes in the renal system, sometimes resulting in system failure.
Poor nutrition during pregnancy can lead to fetal abnormalities that can cause kidney disease in the future (National Kidney Foundation, 2022). Additionally, individuals with renal disease experience more problems during pregnancy and must manage their nutritional intake differently. This section will cover these nutritional considerations and their impact on the renal system during pregnancy.
The Healthy Pregnant Client
Pregnancy is accompanied by expected urinary and renal changes. Increased blood volume and cardiac output result in increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow, which in turn causes increased excretion and reduced blood levels of bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, and urate (Willacy, 2022). In increased GFR, the renal tubules are unable to meet the increased fluid demands, resulting in mild glycosuria and proteinuria; fluid retention increases, reducing plasma osmolality. The smooth muscle of the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder relaxes and dilates, causing the kidneys to increase in length; the ureters to lengthen, curve, and increase in residual urine volume; and the bladder to increase its capacity. The uterus may also put pressure on the bladder and ureters as it increases in size.
Good nutrition during pregnancy can prevent problems and support overall renal health for the pregnant client and fetus. To achieve these aims, the client should do the following:
Increase caloric intake by 340 calories per day starting with the second trimester (for a singleton pregnancy).
Take a prenatal vitamin that includes iron or take a separate iron supplement in addition to a prenatal vitamin to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.
Avoid caffeine or limit it to less than 200 mg daily (Gleason, et al, 2022).
Increase fluid intake, especially water.
(source: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2023; Holcombe, 2022)
Because of the normal physiologic changes expected, specific renal issues that most commonly arise during pregnancy include urinary tract infections (UTIs), pyelonephritis, and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). Changes make urine less acidic, and it contains more hormones and sugars, increasing risk for bacterial growth (Sissons, 2019). Signs and symptoms of UTI include dysuria, frequency of urination, hematuria (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2023b), abdominal cramps, and dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse).
If a UTI spreads from the lower urinary tract into the kidneys and develops into a more serious infection, pyelonephritis, signs and symptoms may then also include fever of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher; flank pain; costovertebral angle tenderness (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2023b); chills; nausea; vomiting; and back, side, or groin pain. Significant fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality have been associated directly with pyelonephritis (Wing & Johnston, 2017). For instance, it has been linked to preterm delivery, in which case all of the newborn’s systems will be underdeveloped; disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to hemorrhage and death of both mother and fetus; and maternal sepsis and respiratory distress, which can lead to renal failure and maternal and fetal death (Wing & Johnston, 2017).
Prevention of UTIs, and subsequently pyelonephritis, is based on urinary hygiene and nutritional recommendations. The nurse should instruct the client to drink 64 to 96 oz of water a day (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2020) and to also drink about 8 to 10 oz of unsweetened cranberry juice (Kubala, 2021) or take cranberry supplements daily to increase urine acidity (Sissons, 2019). Pregnant clients should also keep caffeine intake to 200 mg or less daily (Holcombe, 2022) and eat an overall healthy diet that includes proper nutritional and caloric intake (Sissons, 2019).
Nephrolithiasis usually occurs in the second or third trimester, when there is greater pressure on the renal organs from the growing uterus, and within the first year of giving birth (Furst, 2021; Urology Care Foundation, 2023). The pressure and narrowing of the passages for urine flow can concentrate urine and thus increase the risk for stone formation. Another factor that increases the risk for kidney stones is an elevated vitamin D level, which increases calcium levels in the urine (Orlando Health, 2023). Signs and symptoms the pregnant client may experience include nausea; vomiting; urgency and frequency of urination; hematuria (blood in the urine); and pain in the back, flank, or upper abdomen. The nurse should provide the following nutritional recommendations for nephrolithiasis during pregnancy:
Get adequate daily amounts of vitamin B6 and magnesium (Weinberg, 2023)
Avoid excessive vitamin C (Peerapen & Thongboonkerd, 2023)
Limit sodium intake to less than 2.3 g daily (UT Southwestern Medical Center, 2023)
Drink ten 10 oz glasses of water or other fluids daily (Urology Care Foundation, 2023)
For calcium oxalate stones, maintain calcium intake at 1,000 to 1,200 mg daily and limit intake of oxalate-rich foods (Peerapen & Thongboonkerd, 2023; UT Southwestern Medical Center, 2023)
For uric acid stones, limit animal proteins and eat more plant proteins (Peerapen & Thongboonkerd, 2023)
A recent study has shown that healthy individuals who developed hypertension during pregnancy had twice the risk of developing kidney disease within the first several years after the birth of their baby. Risks were even higher in those who had hypertension before pregnancy and had worsening of their condition during the pregnancy (Malek et al., 2022; Williamson, 2022). Nutritional recommendations for hypertension include limiting sodium intake to less than 2 g daily, getting 4,700 mg of potassium daily, limiting meats and saturated fats, eating 4 to 5 servings each of fruits and vegetables, and following all other recommendations included in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.
Disparity Implications—Pregnancy and Hypertension
When broken down further, a racial disparity exists showing that Black women were much more highly affected than White women: Black women who had hypertension before and during pregnancy were three times more likely to develop kidney disease.
(source: Malek et al., 2022)
The Pregnant Client with Preexisting Renal Disease
Pregnant clients with preexisting renal conditions will be more severely impacted by mild anemia, due to dilution of the blood from fluid retention; an increased GFR, putting more work on the glomeruli; decreased sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, calcium, and albumin; mild glycosuria and proteinuria; reduced plasma osmolality; increased urine retention in the system, which increases infection risks; decreased urine acidity; and increased pressure in the system due to the growing uterus. Preexisting maternal renal conditions that can be affected by pregnancy include polycystic kidney disease (PKD); post–renal transplant status; and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a progressive disease of the kidneys that eventually ends in kidney failure.
Individuals with CKD are at much greater risk for experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes, which can include preeclampsia; acceleration in the loss of kidney function, thereby speeding the process of CKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or complete renal failure; fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); preterm delivery; the infant being of low birthweight or/and small for gestational age (SGA); the need for the infant to receive care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); and maternal or fetal demise (Siligato et al., 2020; Wiles et al., 2019, 2020).
Kidney function declines as much in the nine months of pregnancy as it does for a client living 1.7 to 4.9 years with kidney disease. Therefore, pregnancy could lead the client with CKD to complete kidney failure and need for a transplant or dialysis, purification of blood through means other than the kidneys, which can be extremely dangerous for the mother and fetus (Wiles et al., 2020).
Clients with CKD who have problems with chronic anemia, hypertension, proteinuria, or fluid and electrolyte imbalance before pregnancy will have continuation, and likely worsening, of these problems during pregnancy. Nutritional modifications for these clients involve a delicate balance between the needs of the growing fetus and the requirements of CKD (described later in this chapter). It has been found, however, that plant-based diets that are moderately restricted in protein decrease risks for preterm delivery and SGA status resulting from IUGR (Attini et al., 2022).
The Fetus
Certain nutritional components have been found to be critical for renal development in utero, and the pregnant person’s nutrition before and during pregnancy, as well as during early lactation, has been shown to have a substantial impact on this system. Clients with severe iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy have been shown to have elevated risks for preterm birth, placental abruption, and fetal malformation, which can include malformations of the fetal renal system (Shi et al., 2022). Pregnant clients with various disease processes may need specific dietary restrictions, but low-protein, low-carbohydrate, low-calorie, and low-sodium diets, as well as diets deficient in the micronutrients folic acid, iron, zinc, and vitamin A, have all been shown to have potential long-term adverse effects on the development of the renal system in the fetus (Nusken et al., 2020). High-fat, high-sodium, and high-fructose diets have also been shown to be detrimental to renal system development. Depending on the exact timing of the deficiency or the amount of exposure during development, adverse effects could include an altered number of nephrons, blood pressure dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered sodium handling, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress of the kidney.
Studies have shown that increases in fetal growth and infant birth weight may be achieved by enhancing maternal nutrition during pregnancy (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). Inadequate maternal nutrition during pregnancy is a significant modifiable determinant for the development of chronic diseases in the child (Lee et al., 2021). Nutritional intake that is not sufficiently supplied with key nutrients such as iodine, iron, folate, calcium, and zinc can cause severe health problems in the mother (UNICEF, n.d.) that will directly affect fetal development and the individual’s lifelong health. The nurse should instruct a pregnant client to take in 30 mg of iron, 220 mg of iodine, 600 mcg of folate, 1,000 mg of calcium, and 0.6 mg of zinc daily.

The Healthy Pregnant Client
Pregnancy is accompanied by expected urinary and renal changes. Increased blood volume and cardiac output result in increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow, which in turn causes increased excretion and reduced blood levels of bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, and urate (Willacy, 2022). In increased GFR, the renal tubules are unable to meet the increased fluid demands, resulting in mild glycosuria and proteinuria; fluid retention increases, reducing plasma osmolality. The smooth muscle of the renal pelvis, ureters, and bladder relaxes and dilates, causing the kidneys to increase in length; the ureters to lengthen, curve, and increase in residual urine volume; and the bladder to increase its capacity. The uterus may also put pressure on the bladder and ureters as it increases in size.
Good nutrition during pregnancy can prevent problems and support overall renal health for the pregnant client and fetus. To achieve these aims, the client should do the following:
Increase caloric intake by 340 calories per day starting with the second trimester (for a singleton pregnancy).
Take a prenatal vitamin that includes iron or take a separate iron supplement in addition to a prenatal vitamin to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.
Avoid caffeine or limit it to less than 200 mg daily (Gleason, et al, 2022).
Increase fluid intake, especially water.
(source: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2023; Holcombe, 2022)
Because of the normal physiologic changes expected, specific renal issues that most commonly arise during pregnancy include urinary tract infections (UTIs), pyelonephritis, and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). Changes make urine less acidic, and it contains more hormones and sugars, increasing risk for bacterial growth (Sissons, 2019). Signs and symptoms of UTI include dysuria, frequency of urination, hematuria (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2023b), abdominal cramps, and dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse).
If a UTI spreads from the lower urinary tract into the kidneys and develops into a more serious infection, pyelonephritis, signs and symptoms may then also include fever of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher; flank pain; costovertebral angle tenderness (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2023b); chills; nausea; vomiting; and back, side, or groin pain. Significant fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality have been associated directly with pyelonephritis (Wing & Johnston, 2017). For instance, it has been linked to preterm delivery, in which case all of the newborn’s systems will be underdeveloped; disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to hemorrhage and death of both mother and fetus; and maternal sepsis and respiratory distress, which can lead to renal failure and maternal and fetal death (Wing & Johnston, 2017).
Prevention of UTIs, and subsequently pyelonephritis, is based on urinary hygiene and nutritional recommendations. The nurse should instruct the client to drink 64 to 96 oz of water a day (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2020) and to also drink about 8 to 10 oz of unsweetened cranberry juice (Kubala, 2021) or take cranberry supplements daily to increase urine acidity (Sissons, 2019). Pregnant clients should also keep caffeine intake to 200 mg or less daily (Holcombe, 2022) and eat an overall healthy diet that includes proper nutritional and caloric intake (Sissons, 2019).
Nephrolithiasis usually occurs in the second or third trimester, when there is greater pressure on the renal organs from the growing uterus, and within the first year of giving birth (Furst, 2021; Urology Care Foundation, 2023). The pressure and narrowing of the passages for urine flow can concentrate urine and thus increase the risk for stone formation. Another factor that increases the risk for kidney stones is an elevated vitamin D level, which increases calcium levels in the urine (Orlando Health, 2023). Signs and symptoms the pregnant client may experience include nausea; vomiting; urgency and frequency of urination; hematuria (blood in the urine); and pain in the back, flank, or upper abdomen. The nurse should provide the following nutritional recommendations for nephrolithiasis during pregnancy:
Get adequate daily amounts of vitamin B6 and magnesium (Weinberg, 2023)
Avoid excessive vitamin C (Peerapen & Thongboonkerd, 2023)
Limit sodium intake to less than 2.3 g daily (UT Southwestern Medical Center, 2023)
Drink ten 10 oz glasses of water or other fluids daily (Urology Care Foundation, 2023)
For calcium oxalate stones, maintain calcium intake at 1,000 to 1,200 mg daily and limit intake of oxalate-rich foods (Peerapen & Thongboonkerd, 2023; UT Southwestern Medical Center, 2023)
For uric acid stones, limit animal proteins and eat more plant proteins (Peerapen & Thongboonkerd, 2023)
A recent study has shown that healthy individuals who developed hypertension during pregnancy had twice the risk of developing kidney disease within the first several years after the birth of their baby. Risks were even higher in those who had hypertension before pregnancy and had worsening of their condition during the pregnancy (Malek et al., 2022; Williamson, 2022). Nutritional recommendations for hypertension include limiting sodium intake to less than 2 g daily, getting 4,700 mg of potassium daily, limiting meats and saturated fats, eating 4 to 5 servings each of fruits and vegetables, and following all other recommendations included in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.
Disparity Implications—Pregnancy and Hypertension
When broken down further, a racial disparity exists showing that Black women were much more highly affected than White women: Black women who had hypertension before and during pregnancy were three times more likely to develop kidney disease.
(source: Malek et al., 2022)

The Pregnant Client with Preexisting Renal Disease
Pregnant clients with preexisting renal conditions will be more severely impacted by mild anemia, due to dilution of the blood from fluid retention; an increased GFR, putting more work on the glomeruli; decreased sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, calcium, and albumin; mild glycosuria and proteinuria; reduced plasma osmolality; increased urine retention in the system, which increases infection risks; decreased urine acidity; and increased pressure in the system due to the growing uterus. Preexisting maternal renal conditions that can be affected by pregnancy include polycystic kidney disease (PKD); post–renal transplant status; and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a progressive disease of the kidneys that eventually ends in kidney failure.
Individuals with CKD are at much greater risk for experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes, which can include preeclampsia; acceleration in the loss of kidney function, thereby speeding the process of CKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or complete renal failure; fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); preterm delivery; the infant being of low birthweight or/and small for gestational age (SGA); the need for the infant to receive care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); and maternal or fetal demise (Siligato et al., 2020; Wiles et al., 2019, 2020).
Kidney function declines as much in the nine months of pregnancy as it does for a client living 1.7 to 4.9 years with kidney disease. Therefore, pregnancy could lead the client with CKD to complete kidney failure and need for a transplant or dialysis, purification of blood through means other than the kidneys, which can be extremely dangerous for the mother and fetus (Wiles et al., 2020).
Clients with CKD who have problems with chronic anemia, hypertension, proteinuria, or fluid and electrolyte imbalance before pregnancy will have continuation, and likely worsening, of these problems during pregnancy. Nutritional modifications for these clients involve a delicate balance between the needs of the growing fetus and the requirements of CKD (described later in this chapter). It has been found, however, that plant-based diets that are moderately restricted in protein decrease risks for preterm delivery and SGA status resulting from IUGR (Attini et al., 2022).

The Fetus
Certain nutritional components have been found to be critical for renal development in utero, and the pregnant person’s nutrition before and during pregnancy, as well as during early lactation, has been shown to have a substantial impact on this system. Clients with severe iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy have been shown to have elevated risks for preterm birth, placental abruption, and fetal malformation, which can include malformations of the fetal renal system (Shi et al., 2022). Pregnant clients with various disease processes may need specific dietary restrictions, but low-protein, low-carbohydrate, low-calorie, and low-sodium diets, as well as diets deficient in the micronutrients folic acid, iron, zinc, and vitamin A, have all been shown to have potential long-term adverse effects on the development of the renal system in the fetus (Nusken et al., 2020). High-fat, high-sodium, and high-fructose diets have also been shown to be detrimental to renal system development. Depending on the exact timing of the deficiency or the amount of exposure during development, adverse effects could include an altered number of nephrons, blood pressure dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered sodium handling, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress of the kidney.
Studies have shown that increases in fetal growth and infant birth weight may be achieved by enhancing maternal nutrition during pregnancy (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). Inadequate maternal nutrition during pregnancy is a significant modifiable determinant for the development of chronic diseases in the child (Lee et al., 2021). Nutritional intake that is not sufficiently supplied with key nutrients such as iodine, iron, folate, calcium, and zinc can cause severe health problems in the mother (UNICEF, n.d.) that will directly affect fetal development and the individual’s lifelong health. The nurse should instruct a pregnant client to take in 30 mg of iron, 220 mg of iodine, 600 mcg of folate, 1,000 mg of calcium, and 0.6 mg of zinc daily.

Infancy
Infants must receive proper nutrition for growth and development because all organs are impacted by malnutrition. Well-balanced nutrition should provide enough calories for energy expenditure. Healthy, full-term infants require around 100 kcal/kg/day (Patel & Rouster, 2022), whereas preterm infants require around 130 kcal/kg/day (Medical Home Portal, n.d).
Other nutritional recommendations to consider in an infant’s diet concern micronutrients, including iron, zinc, copper, chromium, manganese, and selenium (Patel & Rouster, 2022). Infants 7 to 12 months old should get 11 mg of iron (Gavin, 2021), 3 mg of zinc (Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, n.d.), 220 mcg of copper (National Institutes of Health, 2022a), 5.5 mcg of chromium (Duda, 2022), 0.6 mg of manganese (National Institutes of Health, 2021), and 20 mcg of selenium daily (Lubeck, 2023). Infants can quickly become dehydrated, so proper fluid intake is extremely important.
The preceding recommendations are for infants born without renal system defects. Those born with renal issues may need nutritional alterations and fluid restrictions based on their level of kidney function. These restricted diets may be in the form of a specially balanced formula that includes 2 to 4 mEq of sodium per 100 mL of formula and a restriction of 1 to 3 mmol/kg/day of potassium (Nelms, 2018). Depending on the specific needs, restrictions may also be in place for calcium, phosphorus, protein, calories, and fluids.
Oligohydramnios, a very low to almost absent amount of amniotic fluid, is a severe condition that must be managed before birth and can be related to impaired or absent kidney function in the fetus (Keilman & Shanks, 2022). Starting at 16 weeks’ gestation, around 90% of the amniotic fluid is made up of urine produced by the fetal kidneys. Immediate treatment for oligohydramnios is imperative because the fetus’s lungs need this fluid to develop properly.
Part A
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.
Jennifer Davis had a difficult pregnancy. Prior to conceiving, she lived with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic moderate anemia, and stage 2 CKD. During the pregnancy, despite being very adherent, her kidney disease advanced. She closely followed her nutritional restrictions for low sodium, low sugar, low carbohydrate, low fat, and low protein, and as she progressed closer to kidney failure, she had to restrict fluids as well. Even though she followed these dietary modifications, after delivery she was diagnosed with ESRD and was scheduled to have a catheter placed to start hemodialysis (mechanical waste filtration).
Because of her health issues, she experienced preeclampsia that developed into eclampsia (seizures), requiring an emergency cesarean birth of her infant at 32 weeks’ gestation. Her infant demonstrated effects from Jennifer’s health issues as well. Due to Jennifer’s chronic anemia, nutritional restrictions, and preterm delivery, the infant was of very low birth weight and small for gestational age (SGA) due to intrauterine growth restrictions. She required 8 weeks of care in the NICU after birth.
Kayla Davis is now 1 week old. She weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb) and is 33 cm (13 in.) long.

Childhood
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) updated nutritional requirements in 2020, including recommendations for infants and toddlers for the first time. It is recommended that children have no added sugar in their diet until age 2 years (USDA, 2020). They should eat a large selection of fruits, vegetables, and grains, preferably with at least half of the grains being whole grains, and their proteins should come from lean meat sources or plant-based proteins (McCarthy, 2021), with low-fat dairy products added after age 2 years. They should not receive the same portion sizes as adults.
In children with altered kidney function, it may be difficult to ensure that they get enough calories and protein to grow within the confines of their restrictive nutritional needs. To protect renal health in children who do not have altered kidney function, sodium should be limited to less than 2 g daily because amounts greater than this can lead to fluid retention and hypertension. Sugar intake should be limited to less than 25 g daily (American Heart Association, n.d.) because it can lead to obesity, hypertension, and kidney hyperfiltration. Children should be encouraged to eat fruits and vegetables because, in addition to their other benefits, the fiber will help prevent constipation (Deshpande, n.d.) and keep cholesterol in check. Fruits also contain citrate, which helps prevent stone formation (Deshpande, n.d.). Adequate water intake of 34 to 61 oz daily (1 to 1.8 L) can prevent urinary infections, constipation, dehydration, and kidney stones and assist in weight control (Deshpande, n.d.).
Common conditions that can develop even if children are not born with renal problems are UTIs, enuresis (bladder incontinence after the age of 3 years), and nephrolithiasis. Nutritional recommendations can help maintain optimal renal health.
Nephrolithiasis has become more common than it once was in children and adolescents (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2021) due to diets higher in processed foods, low vegetable intake, and lower physical activity levels. Risk factors for developing kidney stones in children and adolescents include family history of nephrolithiasis; a diet high in salt, meat, and processed foods; a diet low in fruits and vegetables; dehydration with low urine output; inherited conditions such as cystinuria (a rare condition in which kidney stones form from an amino acid called cysteine) and hyperoxaluria (excessive oxalate in the urine); some medications, including furosemide and topiramate; blocked urine flow; bowel diseases; kidney infection; prolonged sedentary periods, especially bed rest; weight loss surgery (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2021); and UTIs.
Enuresis may be diurnal (occurring in the daytime), nocturnal (occurring in the nighttime), primary (occurring in someone who has never had total bladder control), or secondary (occurring in someone who previously could control their bladder) (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.). Enuresis has many psychological and physical causes. Renal causes include bladder pressure from constipation, overactive bladder (OAB), small bladder, structural problems in the urinary tract, inability to feel when the bladder is full (such as during sleep), UTI, and failure to urinate enough. Many of these causes would need to be addressed with the child’s primary care provider. However, teaching the child different hygiene habits can be helpful, and OAB can be helped by following special nutritional considerations, discussed later in this chapter.
Children urinate more often than adults because they tend to drink more fluids in relation to their size, have smaller bladders, and have less control over their urinary muscles, which results in feeling the need to “go” more often. UTIs can be very common in this age group; therefore, young children need to be educated on proper urinary hygiene (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2015). Girls are more susceptible to UTIs than boys because they have shorter urethras, so bacteria can more readily enter the urinary tract (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2015). General signs and symptoms of a UTI include vomiting, high temperature, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, poor weight gain, and jaundice (NHS Inform, 2023). More specific signs and symptoms include pain or burning with urination; frequency or urgency of urination; deliberate holding of urine; change in toileting habits (such as enuresis); pain in the side, back, or abdomen; bloody or cloudy urine; and foul-smelling urine.
Some nutritional measures can help prevent UTIs. Children should drink plenty of water to avoid constipation and to maintain the kidneys’ function in eliminating waste products. Cranberry or blueberry juice is recommended to create a more acidic urinary environment that will discourage bacterial growth (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2015). Colas and caffeinated beverages should be discouraged because these irritate the bladder and cause diuresis.
Certain foods are beneficial in preventing UTIs as well. Yogurts with live and active cultures and other fermented products are recommended because they contain bacteria that help balance the body’s systems and can thereby decrease the risk for UTIs (Norton Children’s, 2020; Urology Specialists, 2015). Foods high in vitamin C, including oranges, lemons, strawberries, grapefruits, tomatoes, broccoli, and spinach, are beneficial to maintain a balanced urine acidity level (). Foods containing proanthocyanidins, including cranberries, raspberries, and blueberries, are a good addition because these substances help prevent Escherichia coli infection, the number one bacterial cause of common UTIs (Norton Children’s, 2020; Urology Specialists, 2015). High-fiber foods such as whole grains, apples, bananas, and legumes are important to prevent constipation, which can block urine excretion from the body and in turn cause urine stasis, which encourages bacterial growth (Norton Children’s, 2020). Sugar intake should be limited because it provides a fuel source and breeding ground for bacteria to thrive (Urology Specialists, 2015).

Part B
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Part A.
Kayla was diagnosed with hydronephrosis (swollen kidney due to urine accumulation) related to uteropelvic junction obstruction (blockage). This resolved on its own after 2 weeks of life. She was transferred from the NICU to the regular pediatric floor for care at 8 weeks of age and was discharged home the following week. Her prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction have resulted in ongoing effects on her development. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes because her pancreas is nonfunctioning, and one of her kidneys is nonfunctioning. The kidney is small and undeveloped. Luckily, the other kidney is functioning despite the hydronephrosis.
Unfortunately, by age 6, Kayla has developed CKD and is in stage 3 when diagnosed.

Adolescence
During adolescence, puberty, hormonal changes, and growth spurts occur. The body goes through many changes that require healthy and supportive nutrition to ensure proper growth and maturity. Food should include high levels of calcium, vitamin D, and iron for bone and muscle development (Castle, 2022). Iron for males and females aged 9 to13 should be around 8 mg daily. Males aged 14 to 18 should receive 11 mg daily, whereas females in this age group should receive 15 mg daily. The calcium recommendation for adolescents is 1,300 mg daily, and the vitamin D recommendation is 600 International Units daily. Caloric intake should range from 1,800 to 3,200 calories daily for males and from 1,600 to 2,400 calories daily for females, depending on activity level (USDA, 2020).
Adolescents should follow the same nutritional guidelines as other age groups for urinary health. UTIs and nephrolithiasis are the more common kidney-related issues in this age group. The same nutritional restrictions and recommendations discussed elsewhere in this chapter for these conditions apply for adolescents as well.
UTIs have different causes in this group, necessitating additional educational points to discuss with the adolescent. All of the earlier hygiene recommendations are still important, but an additional cause of UTIs in adolescents (as well as in adults) is sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis all can infect the urethra and advance into the urinary system. Females also have increased risk for developing cross infections from bacterial vaginosis (BV) and yeast infections.
Nutritional recommendations to help avoid BV and yeast infections include staying hydrated with plenty of water and avoiding sugary, caffeinated, and carbonated beverages to help maintain a healthy pH balance. Probiotic and prebiotic foods also help maintain the pH balance in the vagina and prevent yeast or bacterial overgrowth. Foods that contain probiotics include yogurt with live cultures, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, miso, tempeh, and kombucha (Sass, 2022). Prebiotics can be found in chicory root, leeks, garlic, asparagus, and onions.
Foods with a low glycemic index may also help prevent BV by helping maintain the pH balance; such foods include whole grains, including oatmeal and barley; quinoa; yogurt; milk; nuts; legumes; beans; grapefruit; oranges; and carrots (Sass, 2022). High-fiber foods support healthy bacterial growth and help prevent BV. Vitamin D has been found to be important in overall vaginal health and pH balance). Foods that contain vitamin D include trout, cooked salmon, sardines, eggs, cheddar cheese, and fortified milk (Sass, 2022). Another important addition to the diet is apples, at least one daily, as these have been shown to improve vaginal lubrication (Sass, 2022; Tommaso et al., 2014). Foods to restrict include white bread, high-sugar foods, white rice, honey, processed grains, and highly processed foods (Sass, 2022).
Part C
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up from Case Study Parts A and B.
Kayla and her mother have been managing her condition well, and her stage 3 CKD has remained stable. She is now 13 years old and has come into the clinic for a regular check-up. The nurse is planning to provide Kayla with education on continued management of her CKD.

Adulthood
Adults will not require as much from their nutritional intake for growth, although certain hormonal changes still occur in adulthood. Individuals in this age group face more health risks that can impact the kidneys and their functioning, including hypertension, diabetes types 1 and 2, CKD, PKD, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), nephrolithiasis, cardiovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia. Foods should be nutrient dense; low in sugars, sodium, and saturated fats; high in fiber and calcium; and include vitamin D (USDA, 2020, p. 101). Nutritional recommendations specific for renal health mentioned previously in the chapter apply to this age group as well. Nephrolithiasis, UTIs, BPH, and CKD are more common in this age group due to the comorbidities that often develop.
Part D
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up from Case Study Parts A, B, and C.
At age 18, Kayla gets pregnant. Her GFR is 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, and she has hypertension, type 1 diabetes, and chronic anemia. Despite the known risks to her and the fetus, she wants to go through with the pregnancy. She is currently not restricting fluids, but she is restricting protein, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, sugar, and carbohydrates. She is following all heart-healthy recommendations.
Kayla decides to continue with the pregnancy despite the risks. During her second trimester, the fetus is markedly small due to intrauterine growth restriction, and Kayla has advanced to stage 4 CKD and is approaching the need for dialysis. Because of Kayla’s rapid decline and the struggle to keep her potassium levels normal, her health care provider orders a catheter to be placed for the impending need for dialysis and plans to deliver the baby as early as safely possible. Unfortunately, 2 days before she is scheduled to have the catheter placed, Kayla goes into cardiac arrest due to a dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia. She is unable to be revived, and her fetus is too premature to survive.

Later Adulthood
For adults aged 60 years and older, the risk for chronic disease is highest. Such conditions include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD, congestive heart failure, cancers, and BPH. Renal function also naturally declines in this age group, with defined GFR being less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (National Kidney Foundation, 2023). Therefore, preserving all kidney function is very important, and medication dosages may need to be adjusted to ensure safety.
Nutritional intake should include nutrient-dense foods and be rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy, as well as protein to prevent muscle loss. Older individuals should also increase their intake of vitamin B12 because the ability to absorb this vitamin declines as people age (USDA, 2020, p. 128). Foods high in B12 include beef liver, clams, cooked salmon, tuna, eggs, fortified breakfast cereal, spinach, and kidney beans (National Institutes of Health, 2022b). Adults in this age group must also be sure to drink enough fluids, especially water, because the sensation of thirst declines with age, increasing the risk for dehydration and UTIs (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020, p. 129).
",6.0,"2022). Iron for males and females aged 9 to13 should be around 8 mg daily. Males aged 14 to 18 should receive 11 mg daily, whereas females in this age group should receive 15 mg daily.

Foods high in B12 include beef liver, clams, cooked salmon, tuna, eggs, fortified breakfast cereal, spinach, and kidney beans (National Institutes of Health, 2022b). Adults in this age group must also be sure to drink enough fluids, especially water, because the sensation of thirst declines with age, increasing the risk for dehydration and UTIs (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020, p. 129).","2021). Adolescents should also consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support overall health and development. However, for adolescents with renal issues, dietary restrictions may be necessary to manage their condition. For example, those with CKD may need to limit their intake of phosphorus, potassium, and sodium to prevent further kidney damage (National Kidney Foundation, 2021). Additionally, adolescents with kidney issues should be encouraged to stay well-hydrated and maintain a healthy weight to support their renal health (National Kidney Foundation, 2021). It's important for healthcare providers to work closely with adolescents and their families to develop individualized nutrition plans that meet their specific needs while supporting their overall health and well-being.","202). dolescents should alo cnsme a diet rich n frt, eetales ole gains d leanroeins toupor ra health and deelopment oweer for adolescents with renal issue detary restrictins ay e necessary to anage tei ondition. or eale the with  ay need to lmit their intae o hosporus, potassiu, and sodim o prevent fuher idney amage (ational idne Foundati, 202).

Discuss the impact of nutrition on acute exacerbation of chronic renal disorders.

Urologic Illnesses
Many different urologic and renal illnesses are impacted by nutrition. Some of the more common urologic illnesses—illnesses that affect parts of the renal system other than the kidneys—that can be impacted by nutrition include overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder cancer. Each of these has different causes and different nutritional impact based on the pathophysiology of the disease.
Overactive Bladder
Overactive bladder (OAB), affecting more than 33 million Americans, causes urinary incontinence and urinary urgency resulting from involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder (Mobley et al., 2020). Anticholinergic medications and beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists are prescribed to treat this condition (Mobley et al., 2020). Some individuals also take 2 to 4 g of sodium bicarbonate twice daily to alkalinize the urine and make it less irritating to the bladder (Mobley et al., 2020).
Nutritional considerations for urologic illness center around reducing symptoms and avoiding medication interactions. Anticholinergic drugs should not be taken with alcohol because this combination can increase the risk for unconsciousness and death (Cafasso, 2023). Alcohol also acts as a diuretic, so clients should avoid it to prevent increased urinary frequency (Stoppler, 2020). They should also avoid carbonated beverages because they contain substances that can irritate a sensitive bladder and increase symptoms. Another important nutritional modification is to eliminate caffeine. Coffee, tea, other caffeinated beverages such as energy drinks, and brown chocolate all contain an acid that acts as a bladder irritant and aggravates OAB symptoms (Mobley et al., 2020; Stoppler, 2020).
Citrus fruits, including oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, and clementines, are also acidic; they can alter the urine pH and contribute to urgency and incontinence, so clients should avoid or reduce consumption of them (Mobley et al., 2020; Stoppler, 2020). Pineapple, tomatoes, wasabi, chili, spicy salsa, and other spicy condiments are all acidic foods, as are cranberries; although cranberries are beneficial for avoiding UTIs, they contain irritants that exacerbate OAB (Mobley et al., 2020; Stoppler, 2020). Sugar, artificial sweeteners, honey, grapes, bananas, apples, peaches, plums, strawberries, raw onions, dairy products (especially sour cream and aged cheeses), prunes, ketchup, vinegar, soy sauce, and mayonnaise can all contribute to an increase in OAB symptoms (Mobley et al., 2020; Stoppler, 2020). Nocturia can be decreased if individuals restrict their fluids during the day, especially after 6 p.m. (Mobley et al., 2020).
Nurses can encourage clients to try food substitutions. Dill, rosemary, thyme, and garlic are great substitutes for the more irritating spices (Stoppler, 2020). White chocolate is recommended instead of regular chocolate because it contains no caffeine, but clients should be cautioned not to eat too much because it contains sugar. Peas and carrots, along with other high-fiber foods, are encouraged to keep bowel movements regular and prevent symptoms resulting from increased pressure on the pelvic floor from constipation (Stoppler, 2020). In addition to estrogen supplementation for women with OAB symptoms related to estrogen deficiency, these clients can benefit from consuming vegetables that contain phytoestrogens, such as yams and carrots (Mobley et al., 2020). These clients should also increase their intake of potassium, protein, and, especially, vitamin D, which works to reduce urinary urgency at the site of the detrusor muscle (Mobley et al., 2020).
Another significant change clients can make is a lifestyle change, not a nutritional one: Clients who use tobacco should stop, as its use is linked with OAB symptoms (Mobley et al., 2020).
Interstitial Cystitis
Interstitial cystitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome, causes pelvic pain and a persistent desire to urinate, as well as nocturia, urinary frequency, and voiding of only small amounts at a time (Mobley et al., 2020). These symptoms mimic those of UTI, but urine cultures will consistently show no infection. Pentosan polysulfate sodium, sodium bicarbonate with calcium glycerophosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide have all been used to treat this condition, and dietary modifications to reduce bladder irritants can effectively supplement pharmacotherapy. Nurses should give the same nutritional recommendations to clients with interstitial cystitis as for those with OAB.
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an enlargement of the prostate gland, affecting men (19 million in the United States) as they age and as their testosterone levels decrease. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include urinary frequency and urgency, a weak urine stream, the feeling of being unable to empty the bladder, postmicturition dribbling, and nocturia (Mobley et al., 2020). Nutrition has not been shown to directly affect testosterone levels, but evidence indicates that the Mediterranean diet can be helpful in decreasing LUTS (Mobley et al., 2020). The Mediterranean diet promotes daily consumption of plant-based foods to replace some meats and starches, and the replacement of unhealthy fats, such as butter and margarine, with healthier fats (Modglin, 2022). This diet is rich in olive oil, small amounts of fish and other seafood, and plant-based options.
Bladder Cancer
Bladder cancer is the seventh most common form of cancer diagnosed, with the highest incidence occurring in White men (Mobley et al., 2020). Tobacco use is the greatest risk factor for the disease. Eating a diet high in isothiocyanates, which are found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and kale, and drinking tea have both been linked to a decreased risk for developing bladder cancer.

Renal Illnesses
Renal illnesses are those that impact the kidney or any portion of the kidney. Many diseases can affect the kidney, and although they may have different causes and initial signs and symptoms, they will also produce very similar signs and symptoms because the diseases all impact the same organ. Common renal illnesses that can be affected by nutrition include nephrolithiasis, CKD, and renal cancer.
Nephrolithiasis
Nephrolithiasis, commonly referred to as kidney stones, can occur as a single incident or as a chronic condition. Kidney stones can cause a wide range of issues, from extreme pain to kidney failure due to hydronephrosis if they block urine flow and are not treated in a timely manner. Nurses should instruct clients to drink at least 88 oz (2.5 L) of fluids a day to help prevent stone formation (Mobley et al., 2022). Fruit juices are also recommended because they contain citrate, which inhibits calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stone formation (Dai & Pearle, 2022).
The type of nutritional modification required depends on the type of stone and its composition ().

Renal Stone Composition and Nutritional Recommendations (source: Dai & Patel, 2022; Ferraro et al., 2020; Karki & Leslie, 2023; Leslie et al., 2023; Levtchencko et al., 2022; Mobley et al., 2020)
Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 31 million Americans, but many remain undiagnosed because the early stages are relatively asymptomatic (Mobley et al., 2020). Many things can cause CKD, but the most common causes are diabetes types 1 and 2 and hypertension, conditions that need to be managed correctly to slow disease progression. Nutrition plays a very important role in the health of clients with CKD, even if they advance to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis treatment or a renal transplant to sustain life.
The stage of CKD is determined by GFR levels, which indicate how well the kidneys are filtering wastes from the blood. (See  in Chapter 15, Applying Clinical Judgment to Promote Nutrition for Renal Wellness.) Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are also monitored closely and change more as the kidneys progress toward failure.
Nutritional restrictions are vital for clients with CKD. Referral to a certified renal dietician can ensure that clients are properly educated and that their nutritional needs are individualized to improve their quality and length of life.
Foods high in calcium include cheese, yogurt, edamame, canned sardines, canned salmon, tofu, almonds, leafy green vegetables, and calcium-fortified foods. Foods high in magnesium include dark chocolate, avocados, nuts, legumes, tofu, seeds, whole grains, fatty fish, bananas, and leafy green vegetables.
Phosphorus should be restricted to less than 800 to 1,000 mg/day, protein to 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day, and potassium to less than 2,000 mg/day (Mobley et al., 2020). Protein should come from lean sources as much as possible, which are those that come from low-fat, high-protein foods such as eggs and skinless chicken.
For clients receiving dialysis treatments, strict fluid restriction is extremely important because gaining too much weight due to fluid retention in between treatments can cause serious side effects. The average fluid restriction for a client on dialysis is 32 oz a day (Fresenius Kidney Care, n.d.). Nurses should instruct clients that fluids are not just beverages and substances that are liquid at room temperature; this category also includes gelatin, ice cream, ice, ice chips, and soup.
Salt Substitutes
Nurses should be sure clients are aware that when a low-sodium diet is required and sodium substitution is recommended, it is dangerous for them to use actual salt substitutes. These substitutes are made with potassium chloride, which can raise potassium to life-threatening levels. Instead, clients should check food labels for added sodium and flavor their food with herbs and other salt-free substitutes.
Renal Cancer
Renal cancer, or kidney cancer, occurs sporadically, but associations with aging, obesity, hypertension, smoking, acquired cystic kidney disease, and exposure to asbestos, cadmium, or petroleum have been observed (Mas Que Ideas Foundation, 2022, p. 24). Most of the time, renal cancer is asymptomatic and found incidentally on an abdominal scan performed for other medical purposes; however, on occasion, a client may experience hematuria, an abdominal lump, or a symptom related to paraneoplastic syndrome, such as anemia, hypertension, weight loss, anorexia, or muscle wasting. Renal cancer will not necessarily cause immediate or automatic kidney failure.
Proper nutrition and nutritional modifications can help lower the risk for renal cancer, prevent adverse effects of cancer treatments and medications, support the highest level of renal function possible, and maintain a client's life expectancy after cancer remission.
Preventing renal cancer is the first priority. Eating grilled and pan-fried foods as well as red meats increases the risk, so nurses should instruct clients to restrict or avoid these (Richards, 2022). Increased intake of vegetables, with special emphasis on cruciferous vegetables, and foods containing vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, tomatoes, and white potatoes, shows promise for decreasing the risk for developing renal cancer (Liao et al., 2022). High-fiber foods; foods rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E and selenium; and foods containing phytochemicals, such as whole grains, may also reduce the risk (Thompson, 2023).
Nutritional changes can address adverse effects of cancer treatment. Many side effects of chemotherapy—such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, flatus, bloating, weight loss, sore throat, gastrointestinal problems, dysphagia, heartburn, dry mouth, mouth sores, and changes in taste and smell—make it difficult for the individual to take in enough calories. Therefore, a nutrient-dense diet with sufficient calories, vitamins, and minerals to ensure proper nutrition is important (Richards, 2022; Thompson, 2023). It should include whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limit foods high in salt and phosphorus (Richards, 2022). Fluid volume status should be monitored because decreased kidney function may necessitate fluid restriction (Richards, 2022). Nurses can suggest that clients with painful mouth sores avoid acidic or spicy foods, alcohol, and foods that are too hot or too cold, and instead eat foods that are soft and easy to chew (Thompson, 2023).
Because of the eating issues that chemotherapy can cause, clients may better tolerate smaller, more frequent meals and maybe even different food consistencies, such as soft, lightly mashed, or pureed foods (Richards, 2022). Brief periods of fasting may even be beneficial during chemotherapy treatment because fasting can generate environments in the body that make survival of cancer cells less likely and help normal cells resist the negative effects of chemotherapy. These periods should be very short, and the client should eat calorie-rich, nutrient-dense foods after fasting.
Another significant effect of chemotherapy is the risk for developing infection. Some nutritional precautions to lower this risk include avoiding unpasteurized juice and dairy products as well as raw fish and raw meat (Richards, 2022). Food preparation and storage are also important in infection prevention, so the nurse should educate the client on appropriate methods.
In maintenance, a plant-based diet may improve survival after renal cancer (Richards, 2022). Because chronic inflammation has been shown to play a major role in cancer, and fruits and vegetables have strong anti-inflammatory properties, fruits and fiber-rich vegetables may have protective effects against renal cancer and its reoccurrence (Thompson, 2023). Since whole grains are high in fiber and contain antioxidants such as selenium and vitamin E as well as phytochemicals, they are also important nutritionally and may help prevent the occurrence and reoccurrence of renal cancer.

Nephrolithiasis
Nephrolithiasis, commonly referred to as kidney stones, can occur as a single incident or as a chronic condition. Kidney stones can cause a wide range of issues, from extreme pain to kidney failure due to hydronephrosis if they block urine flow and are not treated in a timely manner.

Holistic Assessment of Cultural Considerations
Most long-term kidney disease management is focused on CKD. Care of CKD starts with nutritional restrictions and treatment of any comorbidities to prevent disease progression, as the main goal is to prevent the need for dialysis (Satellite Healthcare, 2022). Some religious beliefs involve more restrictions in nutritional allowances and prevent the acceptance of dialysis or transplants, making it even more important for these clients to slow progression as much as possible for as long as possible.
Nurses must be well versed in the nutritional and other care needs of these clients so they can properly educate them to holistically care for their disease as well as live within the confines of their religious and cultural beliefs. Treatment adherence, quality of life, and the self-care ability of clients with CKD and ESRD increase, and risks for complications decrease, when nurses are actively involved in clients’ comprehensive care.

Promotion of Food Security
Food security must be addressed in all age groups to ensure renal health. The National Kidney Foundation has many partnerships with other organizations that are working on initiatives to address food insecurity, especially for individuals with special nutritional needs due to renal issues.
Economic status and the accessibility of grocery stores can affect people’s ability to obtain food. At least 33.2% of low-income individuals live more than a mile from the nearest grocery store (Economic Research Service, 2022). Older adults and individuals with mobility issues may have to rely on others to bring them food and therefore have even more limited food options. Having insufficient ways to obtain food from grocery stores because of transportation issues may lead some people to buy more fast food regardless of their health needs, as fast-food restaurants are often more numerous and easily accessed than grocery stores
Americans have access to a variety of government resources that can help them with food security issues. The Older Americans Act authorizes meal services and related services for those aged 60 and older, as well as their spouses, regardless of age. These services are provided in settings such as senior centers, churches, schools, and community centers, and meals can be delivered to individuals’ homes if they have limited mobility (USDA, 2020, pp. 129–130). The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly called food stamps, is a federally funded program that helps Americans with limited incomes obtain healthy foods and beverages during times of constrained resources (USDA, 2020, pp. 68, 90, 105, 120, 129). These same groups of people can take advantage of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which directly provides packaged food to older Americans with limited income via federally funded resources and distribution help from nonprofit organizations (USDA, 2020, p. 130). The Child and Adult Care Food Program is a federally funded program that provides reimbursement for food served to children and older adults cared for in after-school programs and day care centers, including adult day care (USDA, 2020, pp. 68, 90, 130). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides specific healthy foods for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum and for children aged newborn to 5 years (USDA, 2020, pp. 68, 90, 120). The National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program provide low-income children with breakfast and lunch on school days, accounting for two-thirds of their daily caloric needs for those days (USDA, 2020, p. 90).

Nutrition plays a large role in the developmental process of every organ in the body, including the renal system.
The importance of nutrition for the renal system starts in utero and continues throughout the individual’s entire lifespan.
Normal nutritional needs are altered when renal or urologic alterations exist.
Nutrition plays an extremely important role in promoting quality and length of life in clients with chronic renal illnesses.
Many illnesses can be controlled or prevented with proper nutritional modifications.
The most significant nutritional considerations for the most serious diseases involving the renal system concern fluids, calories, protein, potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphorus.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Recognize the normal function of the gastrointestinal system.
Recognize cues of nutritional impact on the gastrointestinal system.
Analyze cues of nutritional impact on the gastrointestinal system.

Normal Function of the Gastrointestinal System
The gastrointestinal system comprises the organs in the upper gastrointestinal tract—the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum—and the organs in lower gastrointestinal tract—the small intestine, large intestine (or colon), rectum, and anus. The gastrointestinal system is aided by the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, and the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, which are also known as ancillary digestive organs. The sensory system, the nervous system, the mucous membranes, and glands (digestive and adrenal) also have roles to play.
There are four main functions of the gastrointestinal system: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism. Ingestion is the swallowing and absorbing of substances into the body. This process starts with the sensory organs before food even enters the oral cavity: The smell or sight of appealing food can trigger the salivary glands to release saliva. That process, combined with hunger, can increase the desire to ingest the food. Once the food is inside the mouth, its taste, sensed through the papillae on the tongue, can either encourage or inhibit its further ingestion. Foods that register an unappetizing taste encourage expulsion from the oral cavity.
Digestion occurs when the body breaks down what is ingested into absorbable substances. This, too, starts in the oral cavity. The tongue and teeth start the digestion of food using mostly mechanical and some chemical processes known collectively as mastication. Mastication employs the use of the tongue for mechanical compression, abrasion, and distortion; secretion of mucins and lingual lipase, which assist in breaking down lipids; and manipulation to assist with movement during chewing and swallowing (Ogobuiro et al., 2023). The teeth are used strictly for mechanical processes during mastication as they cut, tear, grind, and chew food to break it down physically into smaller pieces.
Chemical digestion and lubrication in the oral cavity to aid in food movement are accomplished by the tongue and salivary glands. There are three pairs of salivary glands in the mouth: the parotid glands, which release salivary amylase to break down complex carbohydrates; sublingual glands, which release a mucus secretion that acts as a buffer and a lubricant; and the submandibular glands, which release a mixture of salivary amylase, buffers, and glycoproteins called mucins () (Ogobuiro et al., 2023).
The food is broken down and lubricated enough during mastication to be swallowed and moved to the next phase of digestion. The swallowing reflex is aided by the tongue, allowing food to travel down the esophagus via peristalsis and empty into the stomach through the lower esophageal sphincter.
The salivary glands aid in chemical breakdown of food in the oral cavity. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Some digestion, both mechanical and chemical, occurs in the stomach, which also temporarily stores food. Food exits the stomach as chyme, a blend of gastric juices and digested food particles. The stomach also synthesizes proteins that are needed for vitamin absorption and microbial defenses, propagates the peristaltic reflex, and releases intrinsic factor from the parietal cells, which enables the small intestine to absorb vitamin B12 (Hsu et al., 2023). When chyme exits the stomach, simple carbohydrates have been digested. Larger molecules such as complex carbohydrates, fats, and proteins have not yet been broken down.
The duodenum breaks down larger molecules. In the duodenum, at the sphincter of Oddi, there is a release of digestive secretions by the ancillary organs (Ogobuiro et al., 2023), specifically from the gallbladder and the pancreas. The pancreas releases active alpha-amylase, colipase, and lipase, and the gallbladder releases bile, produced in the liver, to break down fats, proteins, and complex carbohydrates.
Absorption refers to the taking in of the broken-down substances into the cells. Very few substances are absorbed by the stomach. The small intestine handles 90% of food absorption as food travels through its three segments, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (Ogobuiro et al., 2023). The innermost layer of the mucosa of the small intestine is composed of absorptive cells known as enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells (Fish & Burns, 2022). Enterocytes are effective at absorption because each one has around 3,000 microvilli that expand their available surface area ().
In the small intestine, goblet cells have microvilli to better absorb nutrients. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The duodenum is the site for iron absorption and some vitamin B9 (folate) absorption, but the major site for vitamin B9 absorption is the jejunum (Fish & Burns, 2022). Minerals and vitamins A, D, E, and K are absorbed through the small intestine. The small intestine absorbs 90% of the water from digested food (Fish & Burns, 2022). The last segment of the small intestine, the ileum, is responsible for the absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12 (cobalamin; Fish and Burns, 2022). Each broken-down substance is now in a new, more usable form for use by the body's metabolic processes ().

Nutrients Before and After Digestion for the Body’s Metabolic Use (source: Fish & Burns, 2022)
The last part of the absorption process takes place in the large intestine. It has three main functions in digestion: absorption of the remaining water and electrolytes, absorption and production of vitamins, and formation and movement of feces to the rectum for elimination. The first portion of the large intestine, the ascending colon, removes any remaining water and key nutrients from the indigestible material passing through it while solidifying this waste to form stool.
During this part of digestion, water osmosis causes absorption of the remaining water, sodium is absorbed via sodium channels, potassium absorption is regulated by its concentration in the lumen, and chloride and bicarbonate ions are exchanged. In addition, the large intestine houses trillions of bacteria, which produce many vitamins, including vitamin K, B vitamins, and biotin, through fermentation (Azzouz & Sharma, 2023).
Metabolism refers to the chemical processes by which the body converts absorbed substances to energy. Catabolic reactions release large amounts of protons, which are transported to mitochondria in the cells to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body’s chemical carrier of energy (Sanchez Lopez de Nava & Raja, 2022). An imbalance between energy spent and energy used, or between anabolism and catabolism, can result in obesity or cachexia (Sanchez Lopez de Nava & Raja, 2022). Obesity is clinically defined as an excessive or abnormal accumulation of fat in the body that can increase an individual’s health risks. Cachexia refers to muscle loss with or without fat mass loss.
For these processes to take place effectively and provide balanced nutrition and appropriate energy, the individual must first ingest the proper mix of the required nutrients and water.

Assessment of the Normal Gastrointestinal System
Assessment of the gastrointestinal organs and normal expected findings are explained in detail in The Digestive Process. This section will cover expected physical assessment findings in clients who demonstrate normal nutritional status. Overall normal physical assessment findings in addition to normal gastrointestinal organ–specific findings can help confirm a fully functioning gastrointestinal system ().

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Prioritize nutritional habits that optimize gastrointestinal wellness.
Generate solutions to optimize gastrointestinal wellness using nutritional habits.

Plan Nutritional Goals Based on Testing Results
Nutritional plans (meal plans) should be made with the client based on their specific signs and symptoms. This plan may also include nutrient intake adjustments based on absorption requirements. Nutritional plans should include any nutritional intake restrictions or additions for overall gastrointestinal health based on the client’s specific needs. In addition to the nutrients needed to avoid the deficiencies outlined in , the plan should include foods known to be beneficial for the overall wellness of the gut’s normal microbial growth and should be based on the client’s food preferences and dietary restrictions.
A common vitamin deficiency that displays with abnormal assessment findings is vitamin B. Vitamin B deficiencies that can be found, in order of most importance to the body for normal function, include:
B12 (cobalamin)
B1 (thiamine)
B2 (riboflavin)
B6 (pyridoxine)
B3 (niacin)
B9 (folate)
B7 (biotin)
Several macro- and micronutrients can appear as abnormal assessment findings when deficient or toxic. They are listed as follows in order of importance for normal gastrointestinal function:
Iron
Zinc (deficiency and toxicity)
Vitamin D
Protein (deficiency and toxicity)
Vitamin C
Vitamin A (retinol)
Vitamin E
Magnesium
Potassium (deficiency and toxicity)
Sodium (deficiency and toxicity)
Fiber, calcium, fluids (water)
Phosphorus
Folate
Vitamin K
Fluoride
Calories (underconsumption and overconsumption)
Saturated fats (specifically for overconsumption only)
The client may require enzyme replacement for digestion in the absence of a functioning liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.
When the nurse is evaluating the client’s diet to ensure healthy gut microbiota, dietary additions that might be considered include fiber, additional water, yogurt with active bacterial cultures, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, foods high in antioxidants, and probiotic and prebiotic foods (Afzaal et al., 2022; Gunnars, 2023; Lee et al., 2022; Weersma et al., 2020). Substances that should be restricted include saturated fats and trans fats, sodium, and alcohol (Afzaal et al., 2022).
Before the dietitian or nurse makes any recommendations to add or restrict anything from the client’s nutritional intake, laboratory tests should be done to confirm what the physical assessment indicates. Once that testing is completed, the nutritional plan can be established. Nurses must also understand the synergistic relationships between certain nutrients so they can plan interventions to optimize nutritional progress. For example, if a client is iron deficient, an acidic environment will increase iron absorption, which can be achieved by adding vitamin C to the diet (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2020a). An inability to absorb iron could be directly related to a problem in the gastrointestinal system because most of the body’s iron absorption occurs in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, so adding vitamin C to the client’s diet would be crucial to correct their deficiency (Ems et al., 2023). There are also inhibitory effects to be aware of; calcium, phytates, and polyphenols, for example, can reduce iron availability.
The inability to absorb nutrients is concerning when the client has gastrointestinal disease. Their nutritional plan will include supplementation and higher nutritional intake levels than for a healthy client. A client with a gastrointestinal disorder may eventually require injectable forms of vitamins to stay healthy if they cannot absorb them adequately through oral ingestion. To best prepare a nutritional plan with the client, the nurse must consider the client’s food preferences and cultural practices.

Identify Challenges to Nutritional Goals
A client may face several challenges when trying to achieve their nutritional goals for gastrointestinal health. The first is malabsorption. Even when the client adheres to the nutritional plan of care, their body may be unable to absorb the nutrients provided in their oral intake. Many gastrointestinal diseases can cause these issues (refer to Special Nutritional Considerations for Gastrointestinal Health for greater detail on gastrointestinal diseases). To address such deficiencies, the dietitian, nurse, and health care provider must work closely with the client to monitor laboratory results and add supplementation in oral, enteral (feeding tube), and parenteral forms as needed to reach nutritional goals.
Another challenge that may be encountered is the presence of food allergies or comorbidities. Many foods contain allergens, such as eggs, milk, red meat, nuts, wheat/barley/rye (gluten), shellfish, and citrus fruits. Comorbidities present a concern because if the client already has multiple nutritional restrictions due to other illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease, fewer food options may be available to them. In addition, the client may be less motivated or able to follow a nutritional plan the more restrictive it becomes.
The final challenge to consider is the side effects of the gastrointestinal disease processes a client may be experiencing. When a client has a gastrointestinal disease, they may be dealing with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and/or diarrhea. These issues may cause the client to be unable to consume food or to absorb enough nutrients from what they do consume. For a client with these issues to be successful with their nutritional goals, the health care provider, dietician, and nurse will need to address these issues, and the nutritional plan will need to include foods that do not aggravate the client’s conditions.

By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively with the client, the healthcare team can support the client in achieving their nutritional goals for gastrointestinal wellness.","the client has condtins such as diabetes, hypertension, or he disease, er tion a be alale to the n addition, the client ma  ess ota or ale  follow a nutritional plan t mortt o he alhaee to consider these fctors a o it he client to dee a ealit austinae an ha es i acu the inual cume  areng tes hae d on oraie with the client, the healthcare ta an sor the ie an the nutritional al  toinestna elnss.",43.09031556039173,"the client has such as diabetes, hypertension, or disease, be to the to a nutritional the to consider with the client to a and these and the the",19.047619047619047," such as diabetes, hypertension, or ",3.4013605442176873

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Assess the client for readiness to learn.
Teach nutritional strategies to optimize gastrointestinal wellness.

Holistic Nursing Assessment of the Client
The exact foods included in a nutritional plan should be personalized to each client. Caring for the client holistically requires the nutritional plan to evolve based on the client’s dietary requirements. A holistic nutritional plan should include food items that are appropriate based on the client’s religious, cultural, and personal beliefs. For example, some religions forbid a single type of meat or all meat. In this case, the nutritional plan should include reasonable meat and nonmeat options, such as quinoa or pumpkin seeds, as appropriate to ensure proper protein intake.

Client Teaching
Client teaching for gastrointestinal health should focus not only on general health but also on the specific nutrients known to improve the health of the gastrointestinal system, as discussed in this chapter. Teaching should begin by determining nutritional goals and setting a plan with the client. A registered dietician should be consulted to ensure that the nutritional plan is appropriate for all the client’s needs, including any restrictions. The nurse should ensure that the client understands the education and the plan developed with the dietician and should routinely follow up to make sure the client is following this plan. The client must be an active part of this process so that the registered dietician and nurse can determine if there is a lack of understanding. Active participation also gives the client a chance to verbalize any specific food dislikes or barriers they may have in obtaining certain types of foods.
The nurse should ask the client to use the information they were taught to create a three-day meal plan that includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and beverages. The client and the nurse can then sit down together and discuss good choices and not-so-good choices the client may have made for each meal. This practice allows active learning for the client and is one way to evaluate the client’s understanding of the nutritional plan.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Evaluate a nutritional plan for its effect on gastrointestinal wellness.
Modify a nutritional plan to promote gastrointestinal wellness.

Evaluation of the Client’s Adherence to the Meal Plan
After a nutritional plan has been in place for at least three months, its effectiveness should be evaluated. The client’s ability to follow the plan must first be established before the plan is modified. If a client is not able to follow the plan as prescribed, then changes need to be made based on the client’s unique reasons for nonadherence.
Part B
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Part A.
Mrs. Azan returns to the clinic several months later after meeting with the registered dietician to make dietary modifications. She has been taking her prescribed supplements. Although her previous signs and symptoms have resolved, she is now presenting with unplanned weight loss; pallor; dry, brittle nails; hair loss; edema in the legs; and muscle weakness.

Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Nutritional Plan
After it is established that the client is adhering to their nutritional plan, evaluating the effectiveness of the plan requires checking laboratory results and watching trends as well as performing physical reassessments. If the plan is not effective, adjustments should be made based on the cause of ineffectiveness.
Part C
Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study Parts A and B.
Mrs. Azan has returned for her follow-up appointment. It has been three months since her last visit. Blood levels were redrawn a week ago, and the results show that vitamin B12, magnesium, and potassium have stabilized to a low normal range, but iron is still very low. The laboratory tests ordered also show that Mrs. Azan’s calcium and vitamin D levels are low now despite being normal previously. The 72-hour recall the client reports is consistent with the nutritional goals and education given, and she says she has been following the plan closely. Her food choices are diverse enough to ensure that the calcium and vitamin D levels should not have decreased.
The gastrointestinal system has four main functions: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolization.
The small intestine handles 90% of nutrient and water absorption.
The duodenum is the site for iron absorption and some vitamin B9 (folate) absorption, but the major site for vitamin B9 absorption is the jejunum.
Minerals and vitamins A, D, E, and K are absorbed by the small intestine.
The last segment of the small intestine, the ileum, is responsible for the absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12 (cobalamin).
The large intestine has three main functions in digestion overall: absorption of the remaining water and electrolytes, absorption and production of vitamins, and formation and movement of feces to the rectum for elimination.
The first portion of the large intestine, the ascending colon, removes any remaining water and key nutrients from the indigestible material that passes through it, while solidifying this waste to form stool.
The nutritional plan for clients with gastrointestinal diseases will include supplementation and higher nutritional intake levels than for a healthy client.
Challenges to nutritional goals include malabsorption, food allergies, comorbidities, and side effects of the gastrointestinal disease processes.

Part A
Read the following clinical scenario to answer the Knowledge Check questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.
Hahn Tran is a 53-year-old Asian American client who presents to her health care provider's office with reports of a headache and dizziness. When questioned, Ms. Tran describes her headache as throbbing and that it is worse in the morning when she awakens. She is unable to identify any triggers for the headaches but states they are relieved with acetaminophen.
Ms. Tran reports trying to follow a healthy diet, but states that she does not really know what that means and that she uses a lot of salt in her cooking. She smokes about six to eight cigarettes/day, which is down from one pack/day 3 months ago. Ms. Tran does not exercise regularly and reports having 1-2 glasses of wine on the weekend. She lives with her husband and two teenage children and works in the kitchen at the children's school.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Discuss the relationship between poverty and economic insecurity.
Describe the impact of employment on economic stability.
Explain how housing instability contributes to economic insecurity.
Describe the link between a person’s socioeconomic position and their health.

Poverty
Economic insecurity is when an individual or family cannot consistently afford housing, food, clothing, transportation, child care, or health care. Economic insecurity is directly linked to poverty, a state in which an individual lacks a socially acceptable amount of money or possessions (Merriam-Webster, 2023). In 2021, almost 38 million individuals, close to 12 percent of the population, lived in poverty in the United States (Creamer et al., 2022). Individuals and families living in poverty cannot afford the resources essential to living a healthy life (ODPHP, 2020a). Economic insecurity is also associated with unemployment, underemployment (willing but unable to find full-time work), and low-wage employment. Many individuals with stable work still do not earn enough income to afford the resources necessary for good health (ODPHP, 2020a). Almost one in every three individuals in the United States is considered economically insecure, with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (Langston, 2018). The groups most affected are BIPOC communities, which comprise slightly more than half of the individuals who are economically insecure (Langston, 2018).
The socioeconomic gradient is another term for the relationship between income and health, namely, the association between low socioeconomic position (SEP) and increased disease risk and premature death (Bonaccio, et al., 2020). SEP refers to one’s position in society based on social and economic factors of income, education, and employment. Individuals living with economic insecurity often cannot access resources that support healthy and quality living. These resources, along with economic stability, are what comprise the SDOH: stable housing, safe neighborhoods, access to healthy and affordable foods, and access to quality education. Living with economic insecurity makes it difficult to attain and sustain the determinants of health, thereby perpetuating a cycle of poverty, economic and housing instability, food insecurity, and a lack of access to educational and employment opportunities. This contributes further to income inequality and insecurity and results in a multitude of negative health outcomes (ODPHP, 2020b).
The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) determines poverty levels by using a set of income thresholds that vary by family composition. If a family’s total income is less than the set family threshold, that family and each individual in it are considered to be living in poverty (USCB, 2023). The official poverty definition uses income before taxes and does not include noncash benefits such as public housing, food stamps, tax credits, and Medicaid benefits (USCB, 2023). In 2021, the federal designation of poverty for an individual was an income under $12,880 per year, and for a household (family of four) it was an income under $26,500 per year (ODPHP, 2020b). According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (USDHUD), regardless of the location, a family of four with one adult employed full-time at the federal minimum wage rate is unable to afford fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment (Habitat for Humanity, 2023). Families who live in poverty cannot consistently afford quality housing, food, health care, and other necessities.
Poverty is cyclical and often persists for long periods of time. Research supports the concept of generational poverty, the phenomenon of persistent poverty and disadvantage where children who grow up poor, regardless of race, are more likely to be poor as adults (Wagmiller & Adelman, 2009). In many cases, the foundation of poverty can be traced to structural discrimination and racism that contribute to inequitable social and economic opportunities (ODPHP, 2020b). These deeply rooted practices and beliefs propagate the pervasive unjust treatment and oppression of BIPOC individuals (Braveman et al., 2022) (see Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities). Individuals living in poverty or within impoverished communities lack equal access to the resources necessary for healthy living, such as safe, quality, stable housing and healthy food options. In the United States, BIPOC individuals living in rural areas and individuals living with disabilities are at higher risk for living in poverty.
Living in poverty has been directly linked with poor health outcomes. Those living in poverty or with limited finances may have difficulty accessing care due to the costs of health insurance, medications, and provider visits. Living in impoverished communities with limited access to healthy foods impacts health outcomes related to metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Living with the daily stressors of poverty and having to make difficult decisions such as pay the rent or purchase food increases stress levels and negatively affects mental and cardiovascular health while also negatively influencing health behaviors. Adults living in poverty are at higher risk for adverse health outcomes from smoking, substance use, and chronic stress. Poverty in childhood is associated with developmental delays, toxic stress, chronic illness, and nutritional issues. Mortality rates are higher and life expectancy is lower for impoverished individuals, families, and communities. Within the United States, individuals who earn the top 1 percent of income (meaning they make more than almost everyone else) live 10–15 years longer than individuals who earn the bottom 1 percent of income (ODPHP, 2020b). For individuals living in poverty, economic insecurity is a constant health threat.

Employment
Employment is a main driver of individual economic stability. Stable employment is associated with lower levels of poverty and overall better health. A job’s demands, the work environment, compensation, and the security of the work all affect an individual’s health status (ODPHP, 2020u). Individuals may be out of the workforce (retired or unable to work), employed (working for pay), unemployed (not working but looking for work), or underemployed (involuntary part-time work, intermittent work, poverty-wage work). A lack of employment and underemployment are associated with poverty and economic insecurity. Studies have linked not only illness and premature death with unemployment in adults, but also a delay or absence in receiving necessary medical care and prescriptions (Kansas Department of Health and Environment, 2015). Individuals who are unemployed have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem along with a sense of demoralization. In addition to psychological harm, some of these individuals experience stress-related issues such as hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis and may also experience a stroke or myocardial infarction (ODPHP, 2020u).
An individual’s physical work environment is an important factor in their general health. Repetitive lifting, pulling, or pushing heavy items, exposure to chemicals, or loud noises can all cause significant injury and illness to the worker (ODPHP, 2020u). Time off from work often follows an injury or illness, which can further tip an individual into economic insecurity. Highly demanding jobs, high levels of conflict within the workplace, long workdays, having multiple jobs, and working evening shifts are also associated with psychological stress. These workplace stressors place individuals at risk for depression, strained parent-child relationships, and unhealthy coping mechanisms such as misusing alcohol or smoking cigarettes (ODPHP, 2020u). See Caring for Vulnerable Populations and Communities for a discussion of migrant workers.
Disparities in employment have been correlated with race and ethnic background, gender, and level of educational attainment (ODPHP, 2020u). These disparities negatively impact economic stability and further perpetuate the cycle of poverty. For example, BIPOC individuals are more likely to work in lower-paying blue-collar service jobs and environments with greater exposure to the environmental risk factors described above while White individuals are more likely to work in office jobs and assume managerial positions (ODPHP, 2020u). These exposures place BIPOC individuals at higher risk for injury, illness, anxiety, and depression (ODPHP, 2020u). While the pay gap between women and men in the United States has narrowed somewhat in recent years, in 2020, women earned 83 cents for every dollar earned by men (Wisniewski, 2022). This gap in pay equity between genders negatively affects the economic stability of women and families.
Educational level affects the type of work individuals engage in, the working conditions they experience, and compensation levels. Individuals with lower levels of education generally have fewer job choices and may be forced to accept undesirable positions and low wages. These individuals are more likely to have more physically demanding jobs that may expose them to harmful toxins (ODPHP, 2020u). Many factors may contribute to lower educational attainment, including growing up in poverty with unequal access to educational opportunities.
The Opportunity Atlas
At this interactive website, The Opportunity Atlas, you can click on a map to find out which U.S. neighborhoods offer children the best chance to rise out of poverty. You can trace the roots of today’s affluence and poverty back to the neighborhoods where people grew up. The atlas allows users to search by location, outcome, and demographic group. Explore the atlas, and then respond to the following questions:
What question(s) did you use to explore the Atlas?
What do the areas where household income at age 35 is highest seem to have in common? What about those areas where household income is lowest? And what about those where income falls somewhere in the middle? Thinking about other aspects of these regions, consider what it is about the regions—based solely on geography—that might relate to these outcomes.
Pick one of the articles on the map (indicated by an open book icon) and explore what you find at that link. How does this add to your understanding of poverty and opportunity?

Housing Instability
Affordable housing is another driver of economic stability, whereas housing instability is correlated with economic insecurity. Individuals and families who encounter difficulty paying rent, live in overcrowded residences, move frequently, or spend a large part of their household income on housing are experiencing housing instability.
Households are cost burdened if they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and they are severely cost burdened if they spend more than 50 percent on housing (ODPHP, 2020s). After paying rent, these households are left with little to spend on other necessities such as food, clothing, utilities, and health care. BIPOC households are almost twice as likely as White households to be cost burdened (ODPHP, 2020u). In 2019, there were over 37 million cost-burdened households in the United States, almost 18 million of which were severely cost burdened. Cost-burdened households are at risk for housing instability (ODPHP, 2020u). Substandard or inferior housing is associated with health risks such as asthma, allergies, mental health conditions, and respiratory illnesses related to vermin, mold, water leaks, and inadequate heating and cooling systems (CDC, 2009).
Interactivity: Spent
In the interactivity Spent, you begin by losing your job, life savings, and house. Down to your last $1,000, you must make it through the month by making a series of difficult decisions as you watch your savings dwindle. While this activity is set up as a game, poverty is not something you can simply stop playing, and many Americans make decisions like those in this interactive simulation daily to survive. Walk through the interactivity, and then respond to the following questions:
What factors did you weigh as you decided how to spend your money?
What, if anything, surprised you as you made your choices?
Being cost burdened puts individuals and families at risk for foreclosure or eviction. Renters who are evicted or forced to move often relocate to poorer and less safe neighborhoods (ODPHP, 2020u). Researchers have correlated children who experience multiple housing moves in a year with poor physical health and lack of consistent health insurance coverage. If families must move frequently, building community relationships and attachments is more difficult. Community attachments can be protective for individuals experiencing adversity. For example, research has indicated that individuals living in higher-income areas report better health than those living in lower-income areas (ODPHP, 2020u).
Severe housing instability may result in homelessness, a state where individuals lack a nighttime residence (). The USDHUD Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress found that an estimated 582,500 individuals were experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2022 (USDHUD, 2022). This equates to 18 of every 10,000 individuals in the United States experiencing homelessness. Compared to the overall U.S. population, BIPOC communities continue to be overrepresented among the population experiencing homelessness (USDHUD, 2022). Individuals experiencing homelessness have an increased risk of premature death. In Massachusetts, the mortality rate of individuals ages 25 to 44 experiencing homelessness was approximately ten times higher than that of the general population. A study of individuals experiencing homelessness in the New York City shelter system found that over 50 percent had a substance use disorder, 17 percent had hypertension, 17 percent had asthma, and 35 percent were experiencing major depression, correlating the negative impact of housing instability with homelessness. Children who are homeless are at risk of cognitive and mental health problems, asthma, physical injury and assaults, and poor school performance. Housing instability has broad implications for the development and future of these children (USDHUD, 2022). See Caring for Vulnerable Populations and Communities for more information about homelessness.
An individual experiencing homelessness is at risk for health issues related to inadequate nutrition and exposure to violence, communicable disease, and weather. (credit: “homeless” by Golfeser/Flickr, Public Domain)
Moving to Opportunity
Neighborhoods make a difference in the health and well-being of residents. In this video, Harvard professors Nathan Hendren and Edward L. Glaeser discuss the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program, which assessed the outcomes of moving families with young children out of high-poverty housing projects into lower-poverty neighborhoods (ODPHP, 2020u). The program found that the children of families who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods before the age of 12 were more likely than children who didn’t move or children who moved after the age of 12 to go to college, have higher incomes, and live in better neighborhoods as adults. The women of these families also had improved health outcomes, with lower levels of obesity and diabetes (Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, n.d.). Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
According to the research presented, where in the United States do children have the best chance of upward mobility? Where do they have the worst chance? Why do you think this is so?
Why do you think children who were under age 12 when their families moved to neighborhoods with lower poverty rates fared better economically as adults than children who were older when they moved to these same neighborhoods?
Serena Jordan is a 42-year-old woman who is married with three children, ages three, five, and nine. She works full-time as an administrative assistant at an insurance company. Her husband is a truck driver and is often gone for weeks at a time on the road. They do not have any family nearby, but they rent a second-floor apartment in an old three-family home and have made friends with the neighbors who live on the third floor. The neighbors, an older couple, sometimes help watch the children when Serena is in a pinch. Serena’s family lives paycheck to paycheck, and though she works 40 hours a week, Serena is always worried about being able to pay the bills. Currently, she earns $13/hour, and her husband brings home a salary of $50,000/year, but with the three children, day care expenses, rent, grocery bills, car payments, and medical bills, it never seems to be enough. The family spends almost $2,000 a month on rent, leaving them cost burdened.
Why do you think many people in the United States are experiencing similar situations to those Serena and her family are experiencing?
What are some interventions the community health nurse can do to assist Serena and her family?

Role of the Nurse in Addressing Economic Instability
Nurses need to assess for poverty in all their clients, regardless of appearance or health insurance status. This assessment can be a written questionnaire or an in-person conversation. It might be as simple as asking, “Do you sometimes have to skimp on purchasing groceries to pay your rent? Do you feel you have all the resources necessary for living a modest life?” Often, nurses do not want to ask these questions in case a client answers “No,” as they do not have a solution or they feel the problem is too big for one person to solve, but the first step in the nursing process is always assessment. Nurses need to be able to ascertain this information as a part of the total health assessment to collect data and then formulate a plan. Nursing can significantly impact individuals, families, and communities living in poverty by raising awareness of the prevalence of poverty and its associated negative health outcomes. By raising awareness, nursing can advocate for allocating more resources, such as increased tax credits for families, free early education programs for young children, and better food assistance programs. Community health nurses who assess for housing instability and collect relevant data can intervene with referrals to housing support programs and subsidies that can provide low-income families with financial and housing assistance. Additionally, nurses can advocate for a living wage for everyone by promoting the health and societal benefits of improving conditions for impoverished communities.
Community health nurses can be essential in promoting safe physical work environments to address employment-related health disparities. Nurses should screen all their clients for physical and psychological work-related hazards to formulate an appropriate care plan. They can also work with local and state officials and business owners to advocate for employee benefits and resources such as health insurance, paid sick leave, and parental leave. Community health nurses can also advocate at the local, state, and federal levels for employment programs, free educational training programs, or degree programs for lower-income individuals who wish to further their education, obtain career counseling, and seek access to affordable, quality child care. Nurses specializing in occupational health often work in tandem with corporations to promote healthy work environments. Their role is to protect workers from physical injury related to repetitive lifting or poor ergonomic design and exposure to harmful chemicals and loud noises.

Chapter Summary
Economically stable individuals and families have a steady source of income with consistent access to the resources that are essential for a healthy life, such as food, clothing, safe housing, transportation, quality child care, quality education, and health insurance. A consistent income is the key to economic stability; almost 12 percent of the U.S. population lives in poverty and experiences economic insecurity. BIPOC communities comprise half of the individuals who are economically insecure, and the cycle of poverty often persists across generations. Poor health outcomes, including early cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders, are directly linked to living in poverty, illustrating the concept of the socioeconomic gradient.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Explain the link between food insecurity and food deserts.
Describe the relationship between crime and violence and health outcomes.
Define the term built environment.
Examine how the built environment influences health.
Assess the effect of housing and environment on health.
Explain how environmental conditions impact population health.

Food Access
Nutritious foods are an essential component of a healthy diet. Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy, protein, and oils are all nutritious foods when consumed in healthy portion sizes. Healthy eating habits, defined as eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods and beverages across all food groups within calorie limits, can lower the risk of chronic disease. Foods and beverages with added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, along with alcoholic beverages, are associated with unhealthy diets. Research has consistently demonstrated that healthy eating habits are associated with decreased cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colorectal cancer and improved bone health (ODPHP, 2020q). Therefore, access to healthy and affordable food is vital for health.
Often a result of economic insecurity and poverty, food insecurity is a condition in which individuals or families have limited access to adequate amounts of high-quality food (ODPHP, 2020r). Factors influencing food security include income, employment status, race, ethnicity, and disability. Food insecurity increases when income is limited or unavailable due to unemployment. In 2020, BIPOC households were more than twice as likely as the national average to struggle with food insecurity. Individuals living with disabilities are also more likely to experience food insecurity due to limited employment opportunities and health care expenses (ODPHP, 2020r). In 2020, almost 14 million U.S. households were food insecure at some point in the year, and almost 30 percent of low-income households were food insecure compared to the national average of almost 11 percent (ODPHP, 2020r). Factors influencing this disparity are thought to be related to neighborhood conditions, transportation access, and physical access to food (ODPHP, 2020r).
Healthy food choices are inaccessible in many neighborhoods because full-service supermarkets and grocery stores are not readily available, particularly in certain rural areas and low-income neighborhoods (United States Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2017; ODPHP, 2020r). These areas where residents have limited or no options for affordable and healthy foods are often termed food deserts (USDA, 2017; ODPHP, 2020r; Rural Health Information Hub, 2020b). Limited access to healthy and affordable food sources, income level, transportation access, and distance are barriers to healthy food access for many Americans. Almost 13 percent of the U.S. population lives in low-income food deserts (USDA, 2017). Food deserts are common in locations with small populations and high rates of vacant or abandoned homes; in areas where residents have lower incomes, lower levels of education, and higher rates of unemployment; and disproportionately within BIPOC communities (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2021). Lack of transportation also contributes to food insecurity. Lack of or limited public transportation is a barrier to accessing affordable healthy food. Further contributing to health disparities among vulnerable populations, individuals experiencing disabilities, those with chronic diseases, BIPOC communities, and those living in rural areas are more likely to lack transportation to full-service supermarkets (ODPHP, 2020r).
The Food Deserts of Memphis
This video explores food deserts by profiling two families living in Memphis, Tennessee. Their stories emphasize the reality of what types of foods are available to these families and contrast how higher-income areas within the city have access to many grocery stores and fresh foods while lower-income neighborhoods do not, highlighting the income and zip code divide with a 13-year life expectancy difference between the two parts of Memphis.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How did you feel as you watched the video and listened to the stories? What, if anything, surprised you as you watched the video?
What is the relationship between the former practice of redlining and the current existence of food deserts?
What are some actions the community health nurse can take to address these food deserts?
In addition to accessibility issues, food affordability is a major obstacle, as healthier diets are more expensive than diets rich in processed and refined foods (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2021). Nutrient-poor foods tend to be cheaper and more convenient to access than nutrient-dense foods. Due to this difference, low-income individuals and families tend to rely on these nutrient-poor foods. Convenience stores often have higher food prices with lower quality and less variety of foods than full-service supermarkets (ODPHP, 2020q). Residents of neighborhoods with fewer full-service supermarkets with fresh produce are at higher risk of obesity and diabetes, whereas rates of these conditions are lower among those who live in areas with increased access to grocery stores (ODPHP, 2020q). Studies have demonstrated a link between individuals experiencing food insecurity and higher rates of obesity and chronic diseases such as hypertension and heart disease. In children experiencing food insecurity, studies have demonstrated increased risks of obesity and developmental issues and even a negative impact on mental health (ODPHP, 2020r).

The Role of the Nurse in Addressing Food Access Disparities
Community health nurses play a major role in advocating for individuals experiencing food insecurity. School nurses nationwide have paved the way for free breakfast and lunch for students from low-income families via the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) (ODPHP, 2020r). School nurses, in conjunction with school administrators, are also at the forefront of promoting healthier food options for school-provided breakfast and lunch. Nurses both promote access to food and ensure that the food provided is nutritionally appropriate. This is one example of how community health nurses impact the health of the communities in which they serve.
Community health nurses often work with local food pantries to ensure families in need can access food. Nurses can also help individuals obtain food benefits through programs such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (ODPHP, 2020r). These government-sponsored programs provide food assistance to lower-income individuals and families. SNAP gives a monthly dollar amount, determined by income level, which must be used to purchase food. WIC is meant for pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum parents and for children under age five and provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and nutrient-dense foods (Benefits.gov, 2021). Community health nurses can advocate for increasing access to nutrient-dense foods in low-income neighborhoods to address food disparities and their subsequent negative impacts on health. At the policy level, public health nurses can be involved in policies to limit the number of fast-food restaurants in a community or to incentivize full-service supermarkets to expand into underserved neighborhoods.

Crime and Violence
Violence is a public health issue that adversely affects the target, any witnesses, the communities in which they live, and the perpetrator. It may include child abuse, firearm violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, or elder abuse. Violence has cumulative biological effects on the brain, neuroendocrine system, and immune response, resulting in increased incidence of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death (Rivara et al., 2019). Repeated exposure to crime and violence is linked to an increase in negative health outcomes such as asthma, hypertension, cancer, stroke, and mental disorders (ODPHP, 2020e).
Childhood exposure to violence at home, at school, online, or in the neighborhood is considered an adverse childhood experience (ACE). ACEs are traumatic events such as experiencing or witnessing violence or abuse at home or in the community, having a family member attempt suicide, or any event that undermines a child’s sense of safety, security, and bonding (CDC, 2022c). ACEs are linked to lifelong negative health outcomes such as chronic disease, mental illness, and substance use problems. Additionally, research has found that ACEs can negatively impact education levels, future job opportunities, and overall earning power. Evidence also links exposure to violence in childhood to an increased risk of experiencing intimate partner violence or being violent in adulthood (USDHHS Office on Women’s Health, 2021). Exposure to violence as an adult is also associated with poor health outcomes, such as mental health disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and physical injuries from violence (ODPHP, 2020e). See Caring for Vulnerable Populations and Communities.
Individuals who are economically insecure are more likely to live in impoverished neighborhoods that lack resources and have higher rates of crime and violence (ODPHP, 2020e). Additionally, the national homicide rate is higher for BIPOC adolescents and young adults than their White counterparts (ODPHP, 2020e). Individuals who feel unsafe in their neighborhoods are more likely to avoid community gatherings and outdoor spaces, placing them at higher risk of poor physical and mental health (ODPHP, 2020e). If a community experiences violent crime, families will likely avoid utilizing public parks and partaking in outdoor physical activity out of safety concerns. This negatively affects the family, causing increased isolation and mental health stress and decreased physical activity, socialization, and play for children.

Strategies for public health nurses to address crime and violence include educational programs on building resilience and developing healthy interpersonal relationships. The community health nurse can collaborate on offering school-based programs that build emotional self-awareness and regulation, problem-solving, and teamwork skills to prevent violent behavior. Such educational and training programs can occur in a community center or even an outpatient community health clinic. Building resilience and emotional self-awareness and regulation skills, even from a young age, creates a culture of accountability and potentially reduces violence. Community and public health nurses can also offer parenting classes to help educate families on how to model resilient behaviors and give strategies for dealing with difficult parental situations. Finally, community health nurses can work with community members to provide high-quality child care, mentoring programs for young individuals, and safe, affordable after-school programs to keep children engaged with playing and learning in a supervised environment.
Family Violence Prevention: Kaiser Permanente’s Innovative Model
In this short video, Kaiser Permanente highlights its innovative and effective model for addressing family violence and transforming the health care response to domestic violence. Community and public health nurses are well positioned in the community to utilize this approach in assessing for intimate partner and domestic violence. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How does family violence impact a community?
What are the components of the innovative model?
How might a community health or public health nurse use components of this model in their communities?

The Built Environment
A community’s built environment includes transportation access and roadways, the availability of green space, locations for community gatherings, and the buildings or other physical structures within the neighborhood (ODPHP, 2020d). Almost 20 percent of economically insecure households in the United States lack access to private transportation (Langston, 2018). Low-income individuals without a vehicle are doubly burdened if they reside in neighborhoods without adequate and affordable public transportation, such as bus routes or subways. These individuals may struggle to access schools, work, health care, and other necessary resources. Economically insecure individuals, particularly those who identify as Black, Native American, and mixed/other race, are more likely than those who identify as White, Latina/Latino, or Asian or Pacific Islander to report dropping out of the labor force due to transportation issues (Langston, 2018).
The availability of outdoor green space and access to sidewalks and bike lanes have major health impacts on a community. A lack of green space for outdoor activities and community gatherings negatively affects residents’ physical and mental health and well-being. Children need green space to play outside. Play is a means for children to learn and grow as individuals. It is difficult to socialize with groups of other children if play is limited to indoors only. Walking is a free and easy exercise activity, but residents may be hesitant to participate in this beneficial physical activity without a sidewalk or wide road shoulder to permit safe walking. Bike paths are also a cost-effective way to increase walking, biking, roller-skating, and other leisure activities and can serve as a means of transportation, but if there is not a safe way to engage in these physical activities, they will not occur.
Earlier in the chapter, we learned about Serena and her husband and how they are trying to meet the basic needs of their family of five while living paycheck to paycheck.
Serena’s middle child was recently diagnosed with asthma after having numerous respiratory illnesses. The health care provider has told Serena that she should remove all carpets from the house and ensure there are no pets, woodstove smoke, or second-hand tobacco smoke near her child, as these are all possible triggers for an asthma attack. Serena is very upset, as the apartment they rent has carpet in every room except the kitchen and bathroom and her first-floor neighbors are smokers. Though Serena and her husband do not smoke, they can always smell cigarette smoke in their apartment.
What assessments and screenings should the nurse conduct with Serena?
How could the nurse assist Serena in getting some much-needed resources for her child who has asthma?
How might a community health nurse work with Serena and her family to find strategies to improve their living environment?

The Role of the Nurse in Addressing the Built Environment
Public health nurses are well positioned to work within the local community and government to advocate for shared public green spaces. Building community partnerships is a core policy development role for a public health nurse. From a windshield assessment of the community to raising awareness at the local level and collaborating with policymakers and community leaders, public health nurses can effect positive change within the community. Working with urban design planners and city planners, nurses can advocate for the construction of playground structures, tennis or pickleball courts, and basketball courts to afford more physical activity and community-building opportunities. School nurses can also be involved in this process by advocating for more physical education and outdoor recess time at school and by advocating for more gathering places for children and families to congregate, socialize, and play after school.

Quality of Housing
Housing quality refers to a home’s physical condition and the quality of the environment (neighborhood) in which it is located. Quality housing is characterized by clean air, home safety, enough space per individual, access to heating and cooling systems, and the absence of environmental risk factors. Crowded living conditions are associated with food insecurity, infectious diseases, and poorer mental health (ODPHP, 2020k). Low-income individuals are more likely to live in older homes and homes needing maintenance and repair.
Poor housing quality and poor living conditions contribute to negative health outcomes for a variety of reasons. The presence of lead, mold, asbestos, radon, poor air quality, and overcrowding are all associated with illness and disease. Children under the age of six are at increased risk for adverse health outcomes due to lead exposure because their bodies are rapidly growing and developing and because they tend to put their hands and other objects into their mouths. Children can be exposed to lead from touching, swallowing, or breathing in lead dust from lead paint, pipes, and water faucets. Lead exposure can result in slowed growth and development, damage to the brain and nervous system, learning and behavioral problems, and hearing and speech issues, all of which may result in lower IQs and underperformance in school (CDC, 2022f). Many of the outcomes associated with lead exposure are permanent; for example, lead poisoning may result in infertility, hypertension, heart disease, renal disease, and even premature death (NIOSH, 2021). Even low levels of lead in the blood have been linked to negative outcomes in a child’s attention span and academic achievement (CDC, 2022f).
Many modifiable environmental risk factors related to housing are associated with negative health outcomes. Water issues such as leaking are associated with mold growth, increasing the likelihood of childhood asthma and triggering asthma exacerbation. Mold is also associated with respiratory illnesses, coughing, and wheezing. Exposure to asbestos, a class of mineral fibers used in various industrial products like insulation, cement, textured paint, vinyl floor tiles, roofing, and shingles, may place individuals at increased risk of developing several health conditions. Asbestos in good condition is not considered harmful, but handling asbestos products may release the fibers into the air; if inhaled, they accumulate in the lungs and may cause lung cancer, asbestosis, pleural disease, and mesothelioma (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2016; CDC, 2023). While most modern products do not contain asbestos, homes built before the 1970s may have asbestos, placing low-income families living in older rental homes at higher risk of exposure to it (United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, n.d.). Exposure to vermin such as cockroaches and rodents causes an increased risk for developing asthma and allergies and places exposed individuals at increased risk of psychosocial distress (CDC, 2009).

The Role of the Nurse in Addressing Quality of Housing
Community health nurses can promote the overall health and well-being of an entire neighborhood and community by addressing the quality of housing. Widespread deterioration in neighborhoods can negatively impact the mental health of residents in that community. The social and economic conditions in a neighborhood affect health outcomes as much as the quality of housing, further disadvantaging low-income groups, creating even more health disparities. To fulfill their core assessment function, community and public health nurses should assess the lived experience of community members; appropriately screen for issues such as lead poisoning, mold-related illnesses, mental health illness, and communicable diseases; and then work to develop policies to address these issues. By championing new laws and regulations on housing quality and strengthening support for affordable housing, the nurse is well positioned to lead effective change. Past successes in public health efforts on quality housing include banning lead paint products and creating local building codes and state statutes governing rental properties.
Community Health & Wellness: Health Screenings
In this short video, FIRST 5 Santa Clara County discusses health screenings using evidence-based, standardized screening tools to identify health needs for follow-up assessments. These screenings are completed in elementary schools, preschool programs, and public health clinics, as good health is linked to readiness to learn, fostering better educational opportunities for children. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How are health and education related?
What are some of the barriers to obtaining health care described in the video?
What is meant by the term high touch, high tech, and how is it related to the role of the nurse?

Environmental Conditions
The most common environmental conditions that may negatively impact population health are air quality, water safety, and extreme weather. Indoor and outdoor air quality is a major contributor to health.
Air Quality
Globally, air pollution is estimated to be responsible for nine million deaths per year, equating to one in six deaths worldwide (Fuller et al., 2022). The USDHHS reports that air pollution is associated with 100 to 200 thousand annual deaths in the United States (ODPHP, 2020p). Air quality is affected by pollution from smoke, dust, carbon monoxide, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. Indoor air quality can be affected by environmental smoke, cooking oils and smoke, secondhand smoke, and exposure to mold or radon. Outdoor air pollution can be affected by environmental smoke, car exhaust fumes, and other outdoor air pollutants. Pollution occurs with motor vehicles and industrial plant emissions and fires (). Poor air quality can cause or exacerbate respiratory illness, and air pollution has been linked to lung cancer and heart disease. Urban communities tend to have more sources contributing to pollution and therefore tend to have worse air quality than more rural areas (ODPHP, 2020p). BIPOC communities disproportionately encounter more air pollution than predominantly White communities due to a history of structural racism. BIPOC neighborhoods are more likely to be located near factories and other industrial facilities that emit more pollution due to discriminatory city planning (ODPHP, 2020p). See Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities.
Exposure to loud noises and living in close proximity to hazardous waste sites are other environmental community factors that adversely impact health. Traffic and construction contribute to noise pollution, which is associated with hearing loss and has been found to elicit stress responses in the body. BIPOC communities and low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by noise pollution. Living near hazardous waste sites or industrial facilities is also associated with increased rates of cancer, respiratory disease, skin conditions, and adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to those not living near these sites (Taylor, 2022).

Water Quality
Access to safe, regulated water for drinking, bathing, and cleaning is an important determinant of health. While the U.S. water supply is generally considered safe, it can be contaminated with pathogens or chemicals that can cause illness and disease (ODPHP, 2020e). Each year, an estimated 7.2 million individuals in the United States become ill from waterborne diseases such as cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, pseudomonas, and vibriosis (CDC, 2020b). See Epidemiology for Informing Population/Community Health Decisions. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set and enforce standards for drinking water quality (CDC, 2022e). Despite these regulations, water quality can still be affected by the natural and built environment and by sociopolitical factors. Studies have found a higher risk of exposure to water contaminants, like nitrates, and arsenic, and to poor water quality in BIPOC communities and communities with lower incomes (ODPHP, 2020p). In addition, the SDWA does not regulate private wells, placing some individuals and families at increased risk for water-related issues if their wells are not properly maintained, particularly those living in rural areas without municipal water sources. Well water also has higher levels of nitrates than water from municipal water systems (ODPHP, 2020p). Arsenic is associated with nausea, vomiting, anemia, abnormal heart rhythms, and paresthesias, and nitrates decrease the blood’s ability to carry oxygen to the tissues and can cause hypotension, tachycardia, headaches, gastrointestinal upset, and vomiting (CDC, 2022d).
Water Quality
Access to safe drinking water is a social determinant of health. Consuming contaminated water has serious negative health consequences, such as is being seen in Flint, Michigan, where children are still experiencing the consequences of lead toxicity caused by unsafe drinking water. The problem began in April 2014, when, for economic reasons, the city changed the source of its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River without first taking necessary corrosion control measures. This switch caused water distribution pipes to corrode, ultimately causing dangerously high levels of lead to leach into the drinking water supply. Soon after the change, residents started complaining about the water quality, noting discoloration, smell, and taste, but they were largely ignored.
Pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha was concerned with the number of elevated lead levels she was seeing in her clinic. She reviewed the blood test records of 1,700 Flint children, checking the children’s blood lead levels prior to and following the water switch. She found that in areas where the lead levels were highest, there was the greatest increase in children’s blood lead levels. In 2015, Dr. Hanna-Attisha sounded the alarm about her findings and held a press conference. Two weeks later, Michigan governor Rick Snyder ordered the water to be switched back to Lake Huron (Alfonsi, 2020). However, the corroded pipes continued to release lead into the drinking water. The governor declared a state of emergency in January 2016 (Ruckart et al., 2019).
Lead poisoning is a preventable environmental health threat to children, who are most susceptible to the adverse effects of lead exposure. There is no safe level of lead, as it is an irreversible neurotoxin and impacts cognition and behavior, resulting in potential developmental delays and lowered IQ levels. Lead toxicity can affect every body system, resulting in neurological, renal, hematological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, reproductive, and developmental effects. Lead also crosses the placenta, placing pregnant clients exposed to lead in danger of exposing their developing fetus. Low levels of lead in developing babies have been found to affect cognitive development and behavior (CDC, 2020a; Ruckart et al., 2019). Following the Flint water crisis, an estimated 14,000 children under the age of six may have been exposed to lead in their water. “Three years after the crisis began, the percentage of third graders in Flint who passed Michigan’s standardized literacy test dropped from 41% to 10%” (Alfonsi, 2020, para. 32).
Flint is a city with a majority BIPOC population, and 40 percent of the population lives in poverty (Kennedy, 2016). Do you think complaints of discolored and foul-smelling water would have been ignored for 18 months if the demographic profile of the Flint population were different? What is the role of a community health nurse in addressing this public health issue? Identify interventions the community health nurse could implement to assist families affected by this crisis.
Extreme Weather
Severe weather events such as heat waves, tornadoes, and floods may cause direct injury and death or infrastructure damage that leads to negative health effects. Individuals who experience severe weather may suffer declines in mental health and worsening chronic medical conditions. Often, during severe weather events, the health care system is unable to function normally, creating a backlog of clients in addition to the increased number of individuals who require medical care from direct effects of the weather.
Severe weather events correlate with climate change, a long-term change in weather patterns that describes how rising temperatures and changes in amounts of rainfall impact the planet, with rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers, and associated changes in the blossoms of flowers and plants (Denchak & Turrentine, 2021). More than an environmental issue, severe weather due to climate change is a “fundamental threat to human health and well-being” (Levy et al., 2018, p. 1). The effects of climate change, with increasing numbers of severe weather events and shifts in weather patterns, are expected to continue. Variable weather can include unusually harsh conditions in areas that are not used to and are therefore not prepared to deal with them. Individuals and families in affected regions may experience new or exacerbated financial hardships as they manage living with extreme heat, drought, floods, or snowfall.
In areas unaccustomed to warm weather, the warming climate increases the risk of vector-borne diseases and waterborne pathogens. Warmer temperatures increase the geographic distribution of where vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, can survive, breed, and spread disease. Increasing rainfall, often secondary to warming temperatures, can produce standing water, creating more breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Warmer temperatures also increase the likelihood of waterborne diseases, as warmer temperatures facilitate pathogen survival, and heavy rainfall further mobilizes pathogens and compromises water and sanitation systems (Levy et al., 2018). Extreme heat is associated with respiratory and heat-related illnesses. These heat-related ailments are especially prevalent in urban areas, where the concrete footprint traps and intensifies heat, creating what is referred to as an urban heat island, a city or metropolitan area with a higher temperature than the rural areas around it.
Weather changes disproportionately affect BIPOC communities and those with low incomes due to issues around location, access to resources, and quality of infrastructure. Additionally, individuals who are Hispanic or Latina/Latino are more likely to work construction and agriculture jobs that expose them to more severe weather (ODPHP, 2020p). A study found that in 169 of the 175 largest U.S. urban areas, BIPOC individuals were more likely than White individuals to live in urban heat islands. The temperature difference between an urban heat island and an outlying area can be as high as 20 degrees Fahrenheit (Ndugga & Artiga, 2021). See Environmental Health for more information.

The Role of the Nurse in Addressing Environmental Conditions
Community and public health nurses work within the core functions of assessment and policy development to monitor environmental conditions and their effects on health outcomes. They assess and monitor population health, investigating and addressing health hazards and their root causes. In areas with high levels of air pollution, these nurses monitor the community’s respiratory health, as poor air quality can cause or exacerbate respiratory health conditions. For any increased prevalence of air pollution–related respiratory issues, these nurses educate the public and mobilize community partnerships to address the issue. By cataloging the detrimental health effects of air pollution, public health nurses have evidence to support the implementation of new laws and policies to address its causes. For residents struggling with poor indoor air quality, educating individuals and families on the importance and use of indoor air filters is a great mitigating and possibly a primary prevention intervention.
Community health nurses assess poor health outcomes related to contaminated water and investigate or address these health outcomes. While the EPA sets standards for water quality within public municipal water systems, compliance is often left to local governments. Once a link between water quality and health outcomes is established, community and public health nurses communicate with and educate the local government and the public, and they mobilize efforts to address the root cause. Using legal and regulatory avenues, the public health nurse assures that the community can access one of the most basic human rights, safe water. See Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks for more information on waterborne disease.
Community and public health nurses should familiarize themselves with environmental health concerns and join environmental nursing groups such as the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (ANHE) to stay current on the latest climate change information. A national nursing organization focused on the intersection of health and the environment, ANHE offers many learning opportunities, with podcasts, webinars, newsletters, and other events. Its goal is to advance research, incorporate evidence-based practice on the environment, and influence policy (ANHE, n.d.). Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions (MGH IHP) has opened a Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Health, created and driven by nurse scholars passionate about tackling climate change issues. This center offers many opportunities for health professionals to learn about the issues and to “address mitigation, adaptation, and resilience through education, practice, research, and service related to the health effects of climate change” (MGH IHP, 2023, para. 1).
Nurses can use information from these resources to implement community interventions and to advocate for policy changes to address climate change. Some basic community interventions require community health nurses to collaborate with local government, city planners, and urban designers to investigate ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as promoting the planting of more trees and greeneries, on the street and on rooftops, to relieve heat and improve air quality. At the family level, the community health nurse is in a great position to direct families struggling with heating or electricity costs to resources such as low-income home energy assistance programs.

Chapter Summary
Neighborhoods and the built environment have a major impact on the health outcomes of children and families. Aspects of the neighborhood and built environment, including the quality and safety of water, air, and soil and the quality and safety of the community’s infrastructure, housing, transportation, and roadways, directly impact health. Access to healthy foods that support positive eating patterns impact an individual’s health throughout the lifespan. Locations with limited options for affordable and healthy foods are considered food deserts. Neighborhood safety is a huge public health concern. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are more likely to occur in lower-income communities and are linked to lifelong health outcomes of mental illness, chronic disease, and substance use and negatively impact education and future earning power. Housing quality is an important determinant of health, as lead, mold, asbestos, vermin, and even crowded living conditions are all modifiable environmental risk factors associated with poor health outcomes.

The temperature difference between an urban heat island and an outlying area can be as high as 20 degrees Fahrenheit (Ndugga & Artiga, 2021). See Environmental Health for more information. How the Environment Affects Our Health This short CDC video discusses the intersection of the environment and the social determinants of health, highlighting the importance of environmental health. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions: What are some examples of how the environment can negatively affect health? How might a nurse use tools like the CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Network described in the video when caring for clients in their community? The Role of the Nurse in Addressing Environmental Conditions Community and public health nurses work within the core functions of assessment and policy development to monitor environmental conditions and their effects on health outcomes. They assess and monitor population health, investigating and addressing health hazards and their root causes. In areas with high levels of air pollution, these nurses monitor the community’s respiratory health, as poor air quality can cause or exacerbate respiratory health conditions. For any increased prevalence of air pollution–related respiratory issues, these nurses educate the public and mobilize community partnerships to address the issue. By cataloging the detrimental health effects of air pollution, public health nurses have evidence to support the implementation of new laws and policies to address its causes. For residents struggling with poor indoor air quality, educating individuals and families on the importance and use of indoor air filters is a great mitigating and possibly a primary prevention intervention. Community health nurses assess poor health outcomes related to contaminated water and investigate or address these health outcomes. While the EPA sets standards for water quality within public municipal water systems, compliance is often left to local governments. Once a link between water quality and health outcomes is established, community and public health nurses communicate with and educate the local government and the public, and they mobilize efforts to address the root cause. Using legal and regulatory avenues, the public health nurse assures that the community can access one of the most basic human rights, safe water. See Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks for more information on waterborne disease. Community and public health nurses should familiarize themselves with environmental health concerns and join environmental nursing groups such as the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (ANHE) to stay current on the latest climate change information. A national nursing organization focused on the intersection of health and the environment, ANHE offers many learning opportunities, with podcasts, webinars, newsletters, and other events. Its goal is to advance research, incorporate evidence-based practice on the environment, and influence policy (ANHE, n.d.). Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions (MGH IHP) has opened a Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Health, created and driven by nurse scholars passionate about tackling climate change issues. This center offers many opportunities for health professionals to learn about the issues and to “address mitigation, adaptation, and resilience through education, practice, research, and service related to the health effects of climate change” (MGH IHP, 2023, para. 1). Nurses can use information from these resources to implement community interventions and to advocate for policy changes to address climate change. Some basic community interventions require community health nurses to collaborate with local government, city planners, and urban designers to investigate ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as promoting the planting of more trees and greeneries, on the street and on rooftops, to relieve heat and improve air quality. At the family level, the community health nurse is in a great position to direct families struggling with heating or electricity costs to resources such as low-income home energy assistance programs. Chapter Summary Neighborhoods and the built environment have a major impact on the health outcomes of children and families. Aspects of the neighborhood and built environment, including the quality and safety of water, air, and soil and the quality and safety of the community’s infrastructure, housing, transportation, and roadways, directly impact health. Access to healthy foods that support positive eating patterns impact an individual’s health throughout the lifespan. Locations with limited options for affordable and healthy foods are considered food deserts. Neighborhood safety is a huge public health concern. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are more likely to occur in lower-income communities and are linked to lifelong health outcomes of mental illness, chronic disease, and substance use and negatively impact education and future earning power. Housing quality is an important determinant of health, as lead, mold, asbestos, vermin, and even crowded living conditions are all modifiable environmental risk factors associated with poor health outcomes.","who experience severe weather may suffer declines in mental health and worsening chronic medical conditions. Often, during severe weather events, the health care system is unable to function normally, creating a backlog of clients in addition to the increased number of individuals who require medical care from direct effects of the weather. Severe weather events correlate with climate change, a long-term change in weather patterns that describes how rising temperatures and changes in amounts of rainfall impact the planet, with rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers, and associated changes in the blossoms of flowers and plants (Denchak & Turrentine, 2021). More than an environmental issue, severe weather due to climate change is a “fundamental threat to human health and well-being” (Levy et al., 2018, p. 1). The effects of climate change, with increasing numbers of severe weather events and shifts in weather patterns, are expected to continue. Variable weather can include unusually harsh conditions in areas that are not used to and are therefore not prepared to deal with them. Individuals and families in affected regions may experience new or exacerbated financial hardships as they manage living with extreme heat, drought, floods, or snowfall. In areas unaccustomed to warm weather, the warming climate increases the risk of vector-borne diseases and waterborne pathogens. Warmer temperatures increase the geographic distribution of where vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, can survive, breed, and spread disease. Increasing rainfall, often secondary to warming temperatures, can produce standing water, creating more breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Warmer temperatures also increase the likelihood of waterborne diseases, as warmer temperatures facilitate pathogen survival, and heavy rainfall further mobilizes pathogens and compromises water and sanitation systems (Levy et al., 2018). Extreme heat is associated with respiratory and heat-related illnesses. These heat-related ailments are especially prevalent in urban areas, where the concrete footprint traps and intensifies heat, creating what is referred to as an urban heat island, a city or metropolitan area with a higher temperature than the rural areas around it. Weather changes disproportionately affect BIPOC communities and those with low incomes due to issues around location, access to resources, and quality of infrastructure. Additionally, individuals who are Hispanic or Latina/Latino are more likely to work construction and agriculture jobs that expose them to more severe weather (ODPHP, 2020p). A study found that in 169 of the 175 largest U.S. urban areas, BIPOC individuals were more likely than White individuals to live in urban heat islands.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the association between health indicators and educational level.
Explain the implications of poverty, disabilities, and discrimination on learning and access to quality education.
Discuss the intersection between the social determinants of health and health literacy.

Early Childhood Development and Education
A child’s first five years of life are critical for cognitive, emotional, and physical growth and development. A healthy, safe, and stable early childhood is a key factor in determining if a child will have a healthy, happy life. A variety of social, environmental, and economic factors greatly affect early childhood development. Risk factors for potential developmental delays and future poor health outcomes include early life stressors, low income, and lack of access to quality early educational programs. In contrast, protective factors include higher socioeconomic status (SES), stable relationships with caregivers, and access to quality early education programs (ODPHP, 2020m).
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, early life stressors and ACEs impact a child’s health. Early life stressors such as physical abuse, family instability, poverty, and unsafe environments contribute to developmental delays and poor health outcomes later in life. These children may lack adequate coping skills and have difficulty regulating their emotions and behaviors, thereby struggling in early childhood education programs (ODPHP, 2020m). Inadequate social functioning skills like lack of impulse control, difficulty forming relationships, and trouble regulating behaviors can negatively impact a child’s ability to learn or connect with peers in early elementary school programs.
Poverty, by itself, negatively impacts children's academic achievement. Research has demonstrated that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely than other children to repeat grades and drop out of high school (ODPHP, 2020m). Children from communities with higher SES and more resources have been shown to experience safer and more supportive environments and better early education programs. Quality early childhood programs help foster the mental and physical development of children. They are linked to increased earning potential and higher educational attainment (ODPHP, 2020m).
Early childhood education programs can help reduce educational gaps. Head Start is a federally funded early childhood program that supports children from low-income families. It provides comprehensive services and strives to improve health, increase learning and social skills, and prepare young children for kindergarten. Studies have demonstrated that children who experience quality early education programs like Head Start that are comprehensive and include health care and nutritional components partake in less risky health behaviors such as binge drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and using illegal substances and have lower risks for heart disease, obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia (ODPHP, 2020m). Quality comprehensive early childhood development and education programs reduce risky heath behaviors and prevent or delay the onset of chronic disease in adulthood.
The quality of education in elementary schools is an important determinant in the health and well-being of children. Receiving a high-quality elementary school education reduces educational disparities in children. Children attending a school with safety concerns, limited health resources, and low teacher support are more likely to experience adverse physical and mental health. Until disparities in access to quality early childhood development programs and quality school systems are addressed, children without access will suffer worse health outcomes (ODPHP, 2020m).
Brain Architecture in Early Childhood
In this University of Minnesota Center for Early Education and Development video, Dr. Megan Gunnar discusses the impact of early childhood development on the future abilities and health outcomes of children.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How does early childhood development affect learning later in life?
What are five ways families and communities can help build a strong and proper brain foundation in early childhood?
How does a strong brain foundation impact health outcomes?

High School Graduation
Most jobs require at least a high school (secondary) education. Individuals who do not complete high school have limited employment opportunities, earn lower wages, and are more likely to live in poverty. Disparities in high school completion rates exist by racial and ethnic groups with Black and American Indian/Alaska Native students having the lowest graduation rates (ODPHP, 2020o). Students’ home and school environments impact the chances of students graduating from high school. High school graduation can be impacted by family support, the school district, resources within the school, and the greater community.
Lack of parental involvement in school is linked to lower graduation rates. Teacher quality is also a critical factor; students who believe their teachers are of high quality and that they care are more likely to graduate, whereas students who feel their teachers are uninterested in teaching are more likely to drop out (ODPHP, 2020o). Violence and safety concerns also affect high school dropout rates. Low-income families often live in neighborhoods where schools lack resources and underperform. These factors contribute to higher dropout rates and lower academic achievement. In 2016, low-income families were almost four times more likely than high-income families to have a student not complete high school (ODPHP, 2020o). Economically insecure BIPOC communities are disproportionately represented with lower educational attainment in comparison to economically insecure White individuals. Approximately 85 percent of economically insecure White adults have at least a high school diploma, whereas only about 50 percent of economically insecure adults who identify as Latina/Latino have attained their diploma (Langston, 2018).
Reading skill level in third grade is linked to high school completion rates. One Annie E. Casey Foundation study found that almost a quarter of students with below-basic reading skill level in the third grade failed to finish high school compared with 4 percent of students with third-grade proficient reading skills who failed to finish high school (ODPHP, 2020o). Twenty-six percent of students who were not reading at the proficient level in third grade and who had lived in poverty for at least one year during their school years did not finish high school on time or at all (ODPHP, 2020o). Teen pregnancy and parenthood are also risk factors for dropping out of high school, as only half of teens who have given birth earn a high school diploma.
Many positive outcomes come with graduating from high school. Individuals with a high school diploma have a decreased risk of premature death, more employment opportunities, and a higher lifetime earning potential (ODPHP, 2020o). Lacking a high school diploma is associated with self-reported overall poor health and chronic health issues such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and hepatitis. Additionally, individuals with a high school diploma who are employed full-time earn almost 25 percent more than those who are employed full-time without a high school diploma (ODPHP, 2020o). Supporting individuals to graduate high school is an important public health intervention.

Enrollment in Higher Education
Higher education refers to any education after high school, including community colleges, vocational and technical schools, colleges, and universities. Many higher-paying jobs require a college degree; less than one in five economically insecure individuals have a college degree, whereas half of economically secure individuals do (Langston, 2018). College graduates have more employment options than individuals without college degrees. On average, lifetime earnings for individuals with a bachelor’s degree are double those of individuals without a degree (ODPHP, 2020n). Higher education is associated with better-paying, less hazardous jobs. This all supports an individual’s health, as the higher their income, the greater their ability to secure material and social resources like higher-quality housing and social status (ODPHP, 2020n). Overall, higher education is associated with improved health and a decreased risk of premature death. Individuals with more education are more likely to partake in healthy behaviors, such as drinking less alcohol, exercising regularly, and seeking preventive health care when needed (ODPHP, 2020n).
How well an individual’s middle and high school prepare them for college greatly influences their likelihood of graduating. Students who attend high schools that do not provide honors or advanced courses may be less academically prepared for college-level work than students who attend high schools that provide these courses (ODPHP, 2020n). Students without access to a consistent guidance counselor may not receive help navigating the college application and admissions process. In many low-income neighborhoods, schools lack the financial resources necessary to offer these courses and dedicated guidance counselors, potentially lowering college admissions rates for their students (ODPHP, 2020n).
While the diversity of undergraduate college students is increasing, BIPOC individuals still demonstrate lower levels of academic persistence in college compared to their White counterparts (ODPHP, 2020n). Black and Hispanic individuals also have lower college enrollment and graduation rates. These lower enrollment and graduation rates may be affected by the discrimination, social isolation, and stress of debt accumulation that these students face (ODPHP, 2020n). BIPOC students experience discrimination at rates two to four times higher than White students, and in a study up to a quarter of these students reported feeling that the discrimination they experienced adversely affected their academic outcomes (Stevens et al., 2018). Barriers to higher education exist, but strengthening the curriculum in school districts in lower-income communities and offering more teacher and guidance counselor support can help to better prepare students for the admissions process and the rigors of college (ODPHP, 2020n).

The Role of the Nurse in Addressing Educational Disparities
Community and public health nurses play an important role in early childhood, primary, and secondary education. Partnering with school nurses and administrators, community and public health nurses can use their assessment data as a foundation to influence policy development at the local level. By analyzing trends in the data and presenting this information to the local school committee and city officials, nurses can advocate for meaningful change, such as creating or expanding Head Start programs to ensure equal access to evidence-based successful early childhood education programs. Community and public health nurses can also advocate for increased funding for school districts to create high-quality primary education. Community and public health nurses can advocate for and support transition programs to support students moving from middle to high school. Additionally, nurses can advocate for advanced courses and other programs that better prepare students for the future. These types of programs can encourage students to continue with their studies.
Education Gap: The Root of Inequality
In this video, Harvard University’s Director of the Achievement Gap Initiative, Ronald Ferguson, discusses educational inequality and encouraging efforts that are being made in Boston to address these gaps. This is an example of a community-level approach to addressing educational inequalities that a community and population health nurse can spearhead and lead.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
Why do you think educational gaps exist?
How do you think the Boston Basics program can help address these educational gaps?
What is the community health nurse's role in addressing and responding to these educational gaps?

Language and Literacy
Literacy refers to listening and speaking skills, reading and writing skills, and cultural and conceptual knowledge. Health literacy refers to an individual’s ability to find, understand, and use health-related information (ODPHP, 2020t). Low literacy skills are linked with lower educational attainment, poorer health outcomes, and chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer (ODPHP, 2020l).
Limited English proficiency (LEP) can be a barrier to accessing health care services. Individuals with limited English proficiency tend to be immigrants to the United States who may speak another language at home. In 2019, almost 22 percent of the U.S. population ages five and above spoke a language other than English at home, and among these individuals, 39 percent reported speaking English less than very well (ODPHP, 2020l). Individuals who identify as having limited English proficiency are less likely to have a primary care provider and, therefore, less likely to have preventive health care (ODPHP, 2020l). These individuals also encounter difficulty following medication instructions and communicating with health care providers.
Many barriers impede individuals with limited English proficiency from receiving appropriate health services. A lack of trained interpreters and culturally responsive health care providers adversely affects their health. Cultural barriers, language barriers, and financial difficulties create significant obstacles for immigrants trying to access health information (ODPHP, 2020l). Language barriers create a quality-of-care issue, especially if the provider is not linguistically competent, and a lack of quality trained interpreters impedes access to mental health services for individuals with limited English proficiency (ODPHP, 2020l). See Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Nursing Care for more information on this topic.
Earlier in the chapter, we learned about Serena and her husband, who are trying to meet their family of five’s basic needs while living paycheck to paycheck. Read more about this family, and then answer the questions below.
Serena and her children attend the local community center’s biannual fair. Twice a year, the community center hosts this one-day event for the community's residents, where they have food, games, health screenings, health promotion education events, yoga, senior center representatives, and sign-up sheets for various community groups. Serena decides to have her blood pressure (BP) taken at the screening tent. Her BP reading is 162/92. The nurse takes it manually and repeats it two times, but the readings are similar. The nurse asks Serena about any medical history of daily medications, but Serena shakes her head no. She feels lucky to be healthy overall and does not take any medications except for ibuprofen for headaches occasionally.
What factors could be contributing to Serena’s elevated blood pressure?
What lifestyle questions could the nurse ask Serena to develop a health teaching plan for her?

Chapter Summary
Education is one of the most important modifiable SDOH, as increased educational attainment is associated with an increase in healthy lifestyle behaviors and improved health outcomes. Individuals living in impoverished neighborhoods often have less access to community resources, such as high-quality schools, resulting in significant disparities in educational opportunities. Quality early childhood education programs can help reduce educational gaps, but access remains an issue. Fostering quality, accessible, and affordable early childhood education programs can positively impact educational attainment levels for the most disadvantaged populations. Encouraging and assisting all students to achieve a high school diploma is associated with better employment opportunities and higher-paying jobs, resulting in overall improved health.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the impact of civic participation on individual health.
Define discrimination and discuss its impact on the social determinants of health.
Explain how incarceration is linked to the other social determinants of health.
Discuss the importance of social capital and cohesion in relation to health outcomes.

Civic Participation
Civic participation refers to a range of activities that benefit the community and provide health benefits for participants (APA, 2023). Civic participation helps build social capital, the value gained from having positive interactions and connections between people that enables the community to function effectively and collaboratively in problem-solving efforts. It is these relationships and networks that support the neighborhood and community. By building social capital via civic engagement, members of civic groups are more likely to be physically active and to engage in meaningful activities, providing a sense of purpose (ODPHP, 2020g). Examples include volunteering at community parks or nature reserves, senior centers, community centers, and adult day centers. It can also include civic engagement in the form of environmentalism, education, recycling efforts, composting, farming, and community gardening. Overall, volunteers experience increased psychological well-being and emotional health (ODPHP, 2020g), and adult volunteers aged 60 and above have a lower risk of cognitive impairment (Infurna et al., 2016). Community gardening is associated with increased neighborhood pride, motivation to be involved, and access to healthy foods () (ODPHP, 2020g). Group membership has also been found to increase social capital and benefit members by increasing opportunities for social gatherings. Groups such as the Lions Club, Girl Scouts, and Rotary International clubs can be formal, and there can be informal groups, such as book clubs and walking groups (ODPHP, 2020g). Ultimately, individuals and families who are active in their community and have connections with other individuals in their community are happier and healthier.

Discrimination
As discussed in Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities, discrimination refers to unfair treatment of individuals and groups based on certain characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, and ability (ODPHP, 2020h). It assigns value based on the social interpretation of how one looks or acts, and it manifests in social actions aimed at protecting more privileged groups at the expense of less privileged ones (ODPHP, 2020h). Discrimination is prevalent in the United States, where 63 percent of adults report experiencing discrimination every day, impacting a variety of population groups, such as older adults, certain ethnic and racial groups, individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning, (LGBTQ), and individuals experiencing disabilities (ODPHP, 2020h). Discrimination is a public health threat. It can precede stress-related emotional, physical, and behavioral changes, resulting in adverse health outcomes across the age spectrum (APA, 2022). These adverse health outcomes include tachycardia, anxiety, hypertension, and gastrointestinal ulcers that lead to negative long-term health outcomes over time. Caring for Vulnerable Populations and Communities discusses the effects of discrimination on health outcomes in more detail.
Discrimination occurs at both the individual and structural levels. Structural discrimination refers to institutional policies, systems, laws, and practices that limit individuals' and populations' opportunities, resources, and power based on race, ethnicity, gender, ability, SES, and religion. These deeply rooted practices and beliefs propagate pervasive unjust treatment and oppression of individuals (Braveman et al., 2022).
Discrimination based on race has been linked to significant disparities in health outcomes, attributed to the cumulative effects of racism on the body. Structural racism in health care often results in Black clients receiving poorer-quality care. The 2019 National Healthcare Disparities Report found that White clients receive a better quality of care than almost 41 percent of Black clients (Taylor et al., 2019). In 2018, non-Hispanic Black infants in the United States had 2.4 times the infant mortality rate of White infants (USDHHS Office of Minority Health, 2021). This disparity is rooted in racism; structural racism has resulted in Black women receiving poorer-quality care. On an individual level, the stress from enduring discrimination and racism is cumulative and triggers biological processes that places these women at higher risk for pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, eclampsia, embolisms, and mental health related issues (Taylor et al., 2019). Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities discusses race-based structural discrimination in more detail.
What Is Intersectionality?
This animation defines intersectionality and explores the reasons why common approaches of addressing discrimination fall short in addressing all the negative factors that may hinder an individual’s well-being. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How would you explain intersectionality?
How can the nurse apply the concept of intersectionality in community health nursing?
Can you think of any client encounters from clinical or work experiences where you witnessed the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination at one time? How did this make you feel?

Incarceration
Incarceration refers to confinement in a prison or a jail. Incarceration affects the health of those incarcerated and their families and communities. BIPOC communities and individuals with lower levels of education are disproportionately affected by higher incarceration rates due to the federal policies of the 1960s and 1970s resulting in increased police surveillance and mass incarceration. As of 2018, Black Americans were incarcerated at more than five times the rate of White Americans (Gramlich, 2020). That year, Black Americans represented approximately 12 percent of the U.S. adult population, yet they represented 33 percent of the incarcerated population, while White Americans represented 63 percent of the U.S. adult population and comprised 30 percent of the incarcerated population (Gramlich, 2020). During this same time period, Hispanic Americans represented 16 percent of the U.S. adult population but accounted for 23 percent of the incarcerated population (Gramlich, 2020). Data indicates that White men without a high school diploma or General Education Development (GED) equivalent have a significantly higher risk of being incarcerated (1 in 8) when compared to their more educated peers (1 in 57) (ODPHP, 2020i). Communities with higher rates of poverty and unemployment are disproportionately burdened by higher incarceration and recidivism (being arrested or incarcerated again) rates (ODPHP, 2020i). Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities and Caring Across Practice Settings discuss issues related to incarceration in more detail.
Individuals with a history of incarceration have been found to have worse physical and mental health compared to the general population. Women with a history of incarceration are more likely to have experienced ACEs than women not in the criminal justice system, illustrating how early childhood experiences place certain individuals at higher risk for adverse life outcomes (ODPHP, 2020i). Individuals who have experienced incarceration have higher rates of mental health disorders, hypertension, asthma, cancer, arthritis, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV (ODPHP, 2020i). This heavy disease burden has implications for when these individuals reenter the community. Already at a financial disadvantage, they may have trouble finding employment and a place to live given their criminal record and lack the resources to seek the medical care needed to manage their conditions. This reinforces the cycle of poverty and poor health outcomes. The United States releases millions of individuals from jail and prison each year, yet recidivism is fairly common, as more than 50 percent of individuals are incarcerated again within three years of their initial release. This may be due to the obstacles these individuals face when reentering society (ODPHP, 2020i).
Incarceration often negatively impacts the families of those individuals who are incarcerated. Almost half of incarcerated individuals have minor children, about 19 percent of whom are ages four and younger (Wang, 2022). Having a parent incarcerated is considered an ACE because it places these children at higher risk for cognitive and health-related challenges throughout their lives and because they are more likely to live in poverty and be homeless (ODPHP, 2022i). These children have higher rates of developmental delays, learning difficulties, speech and language issues, attention disorders, and aggressive behaviors, and they are up to five times more likely to be involved with the criminal justice system than children without incarcerated parents (ODPHP, 2020i). Illustrating the generational effects of parental incarceration as an ACE, many incarcerated parents also grew up in challenging situations:
17 percent spent time in foster care.
43 percent are from families that received public assistance.
19 percent lived in public housing before the age of 18.
11 percent were homeless at one point before the age of 18.
32 percent had or currently have an incarcerated parent (Wang, 2022).
Community and public health nurses have a role in identifying children who are at risk due to parental incarceration. After identification, nurses can begin a targeted approach to secure access to resources and educational programs aimed at supporting these children and their caregivers. This involves an interprofessional team of school nurses, guidance counselors, and therapists and early childhood educational programs for those that qualify. Community and public health nurses can collaborate with the justice system to advocate for programs such as drug treatment courts to help keep individuals out of prison while treating their addiction (ODPHP, 2020i). Correctional nurses can provide and advocate for comprehensive health services during incarceration to address the individual's holistic needs (ODPHP, 2020i). See Caring Across Practice Settings. Community nurses can help individuals who reenter the community access health care, employment resources, food, and housing.

Social Cohesion
Social cohesion refers to the strengths of relationships within a community (ODPHP, 2020j). An indicator of social cohesion is the amount of social capital within a community. Places of worship, community centers, libraries, and families are common sources of social capital. Collective efficacy is another aspect of social cohesion and is based on trust. It refers to a community’s ability to create change and influence behavior through social norms (ODPHP, 2020j). This is associated with improved self-rated health, lower rates of neighborhood violence, and improved access to medical care, healthy food, and places to exercise (Matsaganis & Wilkin, 2015).
Research has demonstrated that high levels of social support positively influence health outcomes such as sticking to healthier eating habits, exercise, and even dealing with stress (ODPHP, 2020j). For example, social support contributes to lower atherosclerosis levels (Shah et al., 2021) and is a protective barrier to the harmful consequences of discrimination for many first-generation immigrants (Szaflarski & Bauldry, 2019). Many studies have linked social isolation to detrimental health effects and increased overall mortality, especially in older adults (ODPHP, 2020j). The CDC considers loneliness and social isolation in older adults a significant public health threat, with almost one quarter of adults ages 65 and older considered socially isolated (CDC, 2019). Social isolation also disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including immigrants and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations (CDC, 2019). Social isolation and loneliness are associated with the following health outcomes (CDC, 2019):
50 percent increased risk of dementia
29 percent increased risk of heart disease
32 percent increased risk of stroke
Higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide
Social networks are foundational to a healthy and thriving community. They create social cohesion, can spread positive health behaviors, and give a sense of community to individuals and families (ODPHP, 2020j). Community and public health nurses are well positioned to foster the development of social networks, especially in vulnerable populations. Through senior centers, councils on aging, ethnic centers, local Boys and Girls Clubs, local Y clubs (formerly known as the YMCA), libraries, local government offices, and assisted living facilities, community health nurses are able to nurture the development of community groups and events (). By assisting in the development of programming to refer at-risk individuals and families to existing programs, nurses can make an impact.

County Health Rankings Model
The University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's support, has conceptualized a population health model illustrating a broad vision for health, demonstrating how policies and programs shape a community’s health and outcomes, both quantity of life and quality of life. This video highlights this model, showing all the factors that impact health (the SDOH) and demonstrating that upstream interventions can be implemented at the population health level to ensure that each individual and community thrives.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What are your impressions of this model?
Do you feel the model is an accurate representation of the intersection of health and social, economic, and environmental factors? Why or why not?

Chapter Summary
Communities can help buffer the negative impact of unsafe neighborhoods, poverty, and discrimination through positive relationships and civic participation. By building social capital and relationships within the community, community members are more likely to be physically active, happier, and healthier. Discrimination in any form is a public health threat that results in adverse health outcomes. Structural discrimination is at the root of health disparities seen in BIPOC individuals. The SDOH are intricately tied to structural discrimination, racism, and persistent health disparities. High levels of social support positively influence health outcomes and decrease the incidence of social isolation and its negative impact on mental and physical health.

As a result, community and public health nurses play a crucial role in promoting social cohesion and addressing social isolation. They can work with community leaders and organizations to develop programs and initiatives that foster social connections and support networks. Additionally, nurses can provide education and resources to individuals and groups on the importance of social support and community engagement for overall health and well-being. By addressing social cohesion, nurses can contribute to creating healthier and more resilient communities, ultimately improving the overall health outcomes of the population they serve.","and ve so ui to nds a es, ommunity and public health nurses pl a rcial rle in rooting social coheson and assing cilisoltn e a or th community rs and aitin t develop programs and iitiatives tha foter social connections and support netor diional, nres an proide eduation and resoure t individuals and groups o the iprtanc of social support and ommunit engaemt for overa heath and in.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Define health equity and health inequity.
Describe health disparities in the context of SDOH.
Describe the cumulative impact of inequalities on individual and population health.

Chapter Summary
The SDOH have a greater influence on health outcomes than clinical care. Racism and other SDOH are central drivers of health disparities and inequities within BIPOC communities, creating inequities in access to housing, education, wealth, and employment, thereby placing these individuals at higher risk for poor health. Equity is needed to address the historical injustices that have perpetuated structural racism and discrimination. To influence the health of a population, it is necessary to focus on improving social conditions and addressing the SDOH. To reduce health disparities, individual needs must be addressed holistically. The Future of Nursing 2020-2030 report highlights health equity as a major focus for nursing, and this begins with assessing the SDOH with every client encounter.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Describe evidence-based decision-making in public health.
Describe the steps of evidence-based decision-making.
Explain the importance of evidence-based decision-making in public health.
Identify tools to support evidence-based public health decision-making.
At its core, health care is designed to help enhance the quality of life for clients through preventative care, maximization of development, care of acute illness, and guidance toward death. Health care providers should utilize the most up-to-date information on care and treatment plans in these efforts. Evidence-based public health (EBPH) encourages health promotion, disease prevention, and health maintenance by making the best decision possible based on current evidence. Comprehensively, “EBPH involves accessing the best available research to inform decisions, systematically using data and information systems, applying appropriate frameworks in program planning, engaging the community in assessment and decision-making activities, evaluating the program, and disseminating lessons learned to key stakeholders” (Ruebush, 2019, p. 1). A key part of this effective practice is applying evidence-based information. Evidence-based practice (EBP) and evidence-based decision-making (EBDM) are similar, yet each has its nuances for use in nursing. EBP uses the best available research, clinical experience, and client preferences to inform client-care interventions and evaluation. EBDM is the process of using the most recent research and clinical practice experience to make optimal decisions regarding a policy, practice, and/or program. Foundationally, EBDM extends from EBPH as they both consider the context of the community in conjunction with found evidence to identify and implement appropriate interventions. Additional considerations in the process of EBDM are community partner buy-in, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, health equity, and public sentiment. EBP is used more commonly in nursing practice to drive interventions. EBDM is used in public health to create policies and programs.

Use of Evidence-Based Decision-Making
Public health is a sector of health care that seeks to protect and enhance the health of people and the communities in which they live, work, and play. Since public health decisions and initiatives can impact such a large range of people, decisions in public health made by health care providers must use efficient and effective practices to promote optimal results. EBDM is an optimal process to make these decisions by finding and using interventions that work best in public health and then sharing this information with clients and other health care professionals. The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) has outlined seven steps in the evidence-based decision-making process in public health. These steps are shown in . These steps—define, search, appraise, synthesize, adapt, implement, and evaluate—are additionally broken down to describe the process of EBDM.

(See National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, 2023a; attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
In addition to these steps, EBDM has fundamental characteristics nurses and health care providers must consider (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center [CCHMC], 2023):
Using the best available peer-reviewed information to make decisions
Using multiple forms of evidence
Systematically utilizing data and information systems
Employing program planning frameworks
Optimizing community participation in decision-making and assessment, followed by a comprehensive evaluation
Providing learned information to stakeholders and decision makers
Implementing successful communication, scientific methods, common sense, and political concerns throughout each step
Defining the Problem
The first step in the EBDM process is to clearly define the problem or question that needs to be addressed, thus identifying the concern. Questions to consider in this step include the following:
Who is the target group?
Which problems need to be solved?
What is the anticipated plan to implement these changes?
The concern is generally formatted to address the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time frame in the form of an answerable question or through the development of a PICOT question.  presents the breakdown of a PICOT question.
P
Population
Outlines the client or client population affected by the problem and with whom the nurse will be in contact. Populations may be defined in multiple ways, some of which include the following:
General population: population as a whole
Specific community types: rural or urban dwelling
Population-based descriptors: age, socioeconomic status, risk status, demographics, or literacy levels
I
Intervention
Refers to the change or treatment that will be implemented for the outlined client (population).
C
Comparison
Outlines the reference groups for whom the population in question will be compared. This would be a comparison for the chosen intervention.
O
Outcome
The result that the project will be studying or evaluating.
T
Time
The time interval in which this project will take place, such as when and for how long the intervention will be in place and then compared to the outlined control group.
PICOT Question Breakdown
Identifying each component of a PICOT question is necessary to formulate a clearly defined problem. This question will then guide the literature search and the steps in EBDM in public health. As previously noted, the population may include individuals, communities, or a larger population group. From those categories, the nurse must decide if the population will be further refined, such by age, literacy level, or socioeconomic status. Interventions may be a specific change or treatment but may also be viewed under an approach to health not previously used or studied in this specific population with the outlined concern. The comparison may be a different intervention, often the one currently in practice, or the absence of the proposed intervention. Outcomes will contain measurable results or the aftermath of the implemented intervention. Time outlines how long the intervention will be in place and/or how long outcomes will be measured.  provides example PICOT questions as well as the breakdown of the elements for each question.

Searching the Literature
The next step in the process, searching, involves reviewing the literature to examine what research is available to address the defined concern and additional data points, which should consider the population in question. A clearly identified question will be the foundation for nurses to know how to guide their evidence search. Section 11.2 of this chapter will further discuss where to find evidence-based interventions. Public health may utilize both qualitative and quantitative data or information as they both may apply to this subset of health care, and both may be used to help answer questions in public health. Quantitative research contains numbers and objective data to evaluate outcomes and determine results. Quantitative data are expressed by amounts in numerical terms. Often in public health, this is epidemiologic data. Qualitative research deals with nonnumerical data such as experiences, attitudes, and behaviors. Qualitative data are expressed in word form, cannot be quantified, and describe perspectives of individuals and populations. Another option for seeking information is a focus group. Focus groups are interviews conducted with small groups of participants who share similar traits or interests that will inform the current problem or issue in discussion. These groups are often used to gauge health beliefs, evaluate programs, and provide information fitting the needs assessment.
A community needs assessment is an appraisal that identifies a community’s strengths and resources. The needs assessment gives reviewers a quick overview of existing systems and policies and areas that need improvement or additional resources. Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis covers conducting a community needs assessment in more detail. Often a windshield survey is part of the community assessment. This is the process of observing the community while driving or walking through it to obtain a visual overview. Creating a Healthy Community discusses windshield surveys in more detail. An additional part of this needs assessment is identifying any possible community partners. Community partners are those individuals or organizations who are impacted by the project's evaluations and outcomes and thus are interested in the process. While selecting search modalities, health care providers should consider all public health angles, such as issues in the community context, community and political actions and preferences, research, and public health resources. These link closely with the NCCMT model for evidence-based decision-making as will be discussed further in Section 11.2. Finally, public health nurses may also obtain information regarding a population’s morbidity and mortality rates through the National Vital Statistics System. Public health care providers may also utilize public health surveillance to obtain data. The four types of broad categories for public health surveillance are noninfectious health conditions, infectious diseases, both infectious and noninfectious diseases and health conditions, and risk factors and exposures (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2023a).
While searching the literature, nurses must seek data that precisely notes the experiences and requirements of marginalized communities. Research and scientific work are driven, and thus inhibited, by the perspectives and biases of those who conduct the scientific work. Due to this, there are notable communities and populations that lack accurate representation within studies, scientific theories, policies, and fact statements. To gather accurate information regarding these marginalized communities, nurses should utilize disaggregated data, or data that has been further broken down into subcategories, such as gender or race, to evaluate health inequities. Additionally, nurses must have a full understanding of the social determinants of health and how these apply to the root causes of inequitable health care access and availability. Ultimately, to identify disparities that may go otherwise unnoticed, data should be analyzed from an intersectional vantage point that recognizes the interdependence of different social identities such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, religious beliefs, developmental abilities and disabilities, and socioeconomic status.
Appraising the Literature
While a significant amount of published research may be available for any given concern, the studies may not be of equal caliber. Critically appraising, or assessing each study for relevance and credibility, is necessary to ensure the information provided is meaningful, trustworthy, and relevant. Literature that is meaningful will be useful in some way and/or produce important information. Information is considered trustworthy based on its confirmability and the reviewer’s confidence in the believability of the information produced in the literature. Finally, relevance considers how pertinent the evidence is to the current problem and population. While there may be literature and evidence that provide valuable information, if the information is irrelevant to the topic in discussion or does not consider similar circumstances for the population, it may not be useful or applicable. This appraisal step should help nurses and other health care providers determine if the methods used in the selected studies or data points are strong enough to use in the problem-solving process. Once each source has been appraised for validity and then reviewed, the information can be synthesized. Section 11.2 of this chapter will further discuss where to find evidence-based interventions, and Section 11.3 discusses evaluating the quality of evidence.
In addition to appraising research articles themselves, all other forms of data should be appraised accordingly. Depending on the population, problem, and resources available, some sources may hold a greater weight based on the specific topic and community in question.
Synthesizing the Data
Synthesizing the data involves compiling the information to determine what the research says about the concern/issue. The nurse synthesizing the articles and other data points should consider overlapping themes or messages from different sources. If the research offers conflicting messages, referring back to the appraisal step will be helpful in determining which may be more trustworthy or applicable to the current project. Those with strong levels of appraisal should hold more weight in decisions of application as they will have a deeper foundation. Additionally, in this step, health care providers should synthesize the information gathered from their other data sources to identify common themes or attributes of the community or client.
Adapting the Information
The adapting step of this process involves determining if this synthesized information can apply to the client (which may be a single person, a family, a community, or a population) in discussion. The client will often be a whole community or population in public health. With that type of client, the interventions must work broadly, considering the size of the client. Referring to the synthesizing step, the nurse should identify actionable steps as possible interventions. In the adapting stage, nurses should consider whether these interventions will be successful or relevant to the client in question and/or if the intervention will need adaptation to work efficiently. Components to consider are the identified problem, the identified intervention, the level of client (single person, family, community, or population), and any other stakeholders that need to be considered, such as organizations or partners in the process. Even if an intervention is successful in one community, it may not necessarily be successful in another community. Community and population attributes should be considered to determine applicability across clients. These should be considered and discussed during the dissemination phase of the project. Limitations or additional factors to consider should be discussed to help others determine if the intervention(s) can be applied to their specific population.
Implementing the Intervention
Once the information has been adapted and planned for the issue at hand, the implementation stage involves acting on this information and carrying out the determined plan. This takes place following the previous steps in which a possible intervention or action is identified, and brainstorming has taken place on how this may need to be adapted to the client in question. In this step, public health nurses will identify actionable and tangible steps for the process. In the public health sector, this often includes changes in practice, programs, or policies. This may mean revision of the previously designed practice, program, or policy, or this could be delivery of a new version of these components. The characteristics of the client are crucial at this step as this is a driving force in how interventions may be implemented. Within this plan, indicators of success will be determined by the measurement tools outlined for success.
Thinking back to the appraisal step, recall that interventions may seem optimal to implement based on research conducted but may not be the best option for the current problem. For example, literature might state that frequent time away or vacation would benefit the mental health of teens and young adults. Yet this population may have limitations regarding financial means or transportation that would limit the feasibility of this intervention. While multiple strongly supported pieces of evidence may support the intervention, the expertise of the public health nurse would determine that this is not a feasible implementation for this population. If discussed in the adapt stage, this may be able to be altered to meet the needs of the local context. If not, this would not be an efficient intervention for the population.
Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Plan
Evaluation, the final step in this process, entails determining the effectiveness of the implemented plan by determining if the plan accomplished what was intended and, if not, what may need to be changed moving forward. The previously determined indicators will be used as an objective measurement of success for the project. Once the effectiveness has been reviewed and evaluated, the team may then determine if they should continue with the intervention(s) as designed or adjust them based on the evaluation.
The Importance of Evidence in Decision-Making
The NCCMT has created the video “Using Evidence in Public Health Decisions: Why It Matters” to emphasize why using evidence-informed decision-making is essential in public health. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How does EBDM impact financial decisions regarding implementation of health interventions?
Discuss how EBDM can help build the relationship between health care providers and the public.
Additionally, the information should be disseminated for use by other health care providers or systems. An essential step in all health care research is sharing results to benefit the population as a whole. Sharing information within the nursing community increases the scope of knowledge within the field and helps to ensure all parties stay up-to-date with policies, practices, programs, and interventions. This may also optimize the cost and quality of care by sharing what has or has not worked in the past. This eliminates multiple steps of trial and error regarding the same topic.
Part A
Read the following scenario about Amari and Milo. Then answer the questions that follow.
Recall from the scenario at the beginning of this chapter that Amari and Milo have noticed an increased rate of anxiety in teens within their community and that the interventions they have used previously are not eliciting the same results. To efficiently identify possible interventions for this population, they know their best option is to use evidence-based practice strategies and that they must first draft a PICOT question as the foundation for their EBP project.
Amari and Milo develop the following PICOT question: Does daily exercise have an impact on anxiety rates in adolescents compared to those who do not engage in daily exercise over three months?

Defining the Problem
The first step in the EBDM process is to clearly define the problem or question that needs to be addressed, thus identifying the concern. Questions to consider in this step include the following:
Who is the target group?
Which problems need to be solved?
What is the anticipated plan to implement these changes?
The concern is generally formatted to address the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time frame in the form of an answerable question or through the development of a PICOT question.  presents the breakdown of a PICOT question.
P
Population
Outlines the client or client population affected by the problem and with whom the nurse will be in contact. Populations may be defined in multiple ways, some of which include the following:
General population: population as a whole
Specific community types: rural or urban dwelling
Population-based descriptors: age, socioeconomic status, risk status, demographics, or literacy levels
I
Intervention
Refers to the change or treatment that will be implemented for the outlined client (population).
C
Comparison
Outlines the reference groups for whom the population in question will be compared. This would be a comparison for the chosen intervention.
O
Outcome
The result that the project will be studying or evaluating.
T
Time
The time interval in which this project will take place, such as when and for how long the intervention will be in place and then compared to the outlined control group.
PICOT Question Breakdown
Identifying each component of a PICOT question is necessary to formulate a clearly defined problem. This question will then guide the literature search and the steps in EBDM in public health. As previously noted, the population may include individuals, communities, or a larger population group. From those categories, the nurse must decide if the population will be further refined, such by age, literacy level, or socioeconomic status. Interventions may be a specific change or treatment but may also be viewed under an approach to health not previously used or studied in this specific population with the outlined concern. The comparison may be a different intervention, often the one currently in practice, or the absence of the proposed intervention. Outcomes will contain measurable results or the aftermath of the implemented intervention. Time outlines how long the intervention will be in place and/or how long outcomes will be measured.  provides example PICOT questions as well as the breakdown of the elements for each question.

Searching the Literature
The next step in the process, searching, involves reviewing the literature to examine what research is available to address the defined concern and additional data points, which should consider the population in question. A clearly identified question will be the foundation for nurses to know how to guide their evidence search. Section 11.2 of this chapter will further discuss where to find evidence-based interventions. Public health may utilize both qualitative and quantitative data or information as they both may apply to this subset of health care, and both may be used to help answer questions in public health. Quantitative research contains numbers and objective data to evaluate outcomes and determine results. Quantitative data are expressed by amounts in numerical terms. Often in public health, this is epidemiologic data. Qualitative research deals with nonnumerical data such as experiences, attitudes, and behaviors. Qualitative data are expressed in word form, cannot be quantified, and describe perspectives of individuals and populations. Another option for seeking information is a focus group. Focus groups are interviews conducted with small groups of participants who share similar traits or interests that will inform the current problem or issue in discussion. These groups are often used to gauge health beliefs, evaluate programs, and provide information fitting the needs assessment.
A community needs assessment is an appraisal that identifies a community’s strengths and resources. The needs assessment gives reviewers a quick overview of existing systems and policies and areas that need improvement or additional resources. Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis covers conducting a community needs assessment in more detail. Often a windshield survey is part of the community assessment. This is the process of observing the community while driving or walking through it to obtain a visual overview. Creating a Healthy Community discusses windshield surveys in more detail. An additional part of this needs assessment is identifying any possible community partners. Community partners are those individuals or organizations who are impacted by the project's evaluations and outcomes and thus are interested in the process. While selecting search modalities, health care providers should consider all public health angles, such as issues in the community context, community and political actions and preferences, research, and public health resources. These link closely with the NCCMT model for evidence-based decision-making as will be discussed further in Section 11.2. Finally, public health nurses may also obtain information regarding a population’s morbidity and mortality rates through the National Vital Statistics System. Public health care providers may also utilize public health surveillance to obtain data. The four types of broad categories for public health surveillance are noninfectious health conditions, infectious diseases, both infectious and noninfectious diseases and health conditions, and risk factors and exposures (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2023a).
While searching the literature, nurses must seek data that precisely notes the experiences and requirements of marginalized communities. Research and scientific work are driven, and thus inhibited, by the perspectives and biases of those who conduct the scientific work. Due to this, there are notable communities and populations that lack accurate representation within studies, scientific theories, policies, and fact statements. To gather accurate information regarding these marginalized communities, nurses should utilize disaggregated data, or data that has been further broken down into subcategories, such as gender or race, to evaluate health inequities. Additionally, nurses must have a full understanding of the social determinants of health and how these apply to the root causes of inequitable health care access and availability. Ultimately, to identify disparities that may go otherwise unnoticed, data should be analyzed from an intersectional vantage point that recognizes the interdependence of different social identities such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, religious beliefs, developmental abilities and disabilities, and socioeconomic status.

Appraising the Literature
While a significant amount of published research may be available for any given concern, the studies may not be of equal caliber. Critically appraising, or assessing each study for relevance and credibility, is necessary to ensure the information provided is meaningful, trustworthy, and relevant. Literature that is meaningful will be useful in some way and/or produce important information. Information is considered trustworthy based on its confirmability and the reviewer’s confidence in the believability of the information produced in the literature. Finally, relevance considers how pertinent the evidence is to the current problem and population. While there may be literature and evidence that provide valuable information, if the information is irrelevant to the topic in discussion or does not consider similar circumstances for the population, it may not be useful or applicable. This appraisal step should help nurses and other health care providers determine if the methods used in the selected studies or data points are strong enough to use in the problem-solving process. Once each source has been appraised for validity and then reviewed, the information can be synthesized. Section 11.2 of this chapter will further discuss where to find evidence-based interventions, and Section 11.3 discusses evaluating the quality of evidence.
In addition to appraising research articles themselves, all other forms of data should be appraised accordingly. Depending on the population, problem, and resources available, some sources may hold a greater weight based on the specific topic and community in question.

Synthesizing the Data
Synthesizing the data involves compiling the information to determine what the research says about the concern/issue. The nurse synthesizing the articles and other data points should consider overlapping themes or messages from different sources. If the research offers conflicting messages, referring back to the appraisal step will be helpful in determining which may be more trustworthy or applicable to the current project. Those with strong levels of appraisal should hold more weight in decisions of application as they will have a deeper foundation. Additionally, in this step, health care providers should synthesize the information gathered from their other data sources to identify common themes or attributes of the community or client.

Adapting the Information
The adapting step of this process involves determining if this synthesized information can apply to the client (which may be a single person, a family, a community, or a population) in discussion. The client will often be a whole community or population in public health. With that type of client, the interventions must work broadly, considering the size of the client. Referring to the synthesizing step, the nurse should identify actionable steps as possible interventions. In the adapting stage, nurses should consider whether these interventions will be successful or relevant to the client in question and/or if the intervention will need adaptation to work efficiently. Components to consider are the identified problem, the identified intervention, the level of client (single person, family, community, or population), and any other stakeholders that need to be considered, such as organizations or partners in the process. Even if an intervention is successful in one community, it may not necessarily be successful in another community. Community and population attributes should be considered to determine applicability across clients. These should be considered and discussed during the dissemination phase of the project. Limitations or additional factors to consider should be discussed to help others determine if the intervention(s) can be applied to their specific population.

Implementing the Intervention
Once the information has been adapted and planned for the issue at hand, the implementation stage involves acting on this information and carrying out the determined plan. This takes place following the previous steps in which a possible intervention or action is identified, and brainstorming has taken place on how this may need to be adapted to the client in question. In this step, public health nurses will identify actionable and tangible steps for the process. In the public health sector, this often includes changes in practice, programs, or policies. This may mean revision of the previously designed practice, program, or policy, or this could be delivery of a new version of these components. The characteristics of the client are crucial at this step as this is a driving force in how interventions may be implemented. Within this plan, indicators of success will be determined by the measurement tools outlined for success.
Thinking back to the appraisal step, recall that interventions may seem optimal to implement based on research conducted but may not be the best option for the current problem. For example, literature might state that frequent time away or vacation would benefit the mental health of teens and young adults. Yet this population may have limitations regarding financial means or transportation that would limit the feasibility of this intervention. While multiple strongly supported pieces of evidence may support the intervention, the expertise of the public health nurse would determine that this is not a feasible implementation for this population. If discussed in the adapt stage, this may be able to be altered to meet the needs of the local context. If not, this would not be an efficient intervention for the population.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Plan
Evaluation, the final step in this process, entails determining the effectiveness of the implemented plan by determining if the plan accomplished what was intended and, if not, what may need to be changed moving forward. The previously determined indicators will be used as an objective measurement of success for the project. Once the effectiveness has been reviewed and evaluated, the team may then determine if they should continue with the intervention(s) as designed or adjust them based on the evaluation.

Sharing information within the nursing community increases the scope of knowledge within the field and helps to ensure all parties stay up-to-date with policies, practices, programs, and interventions. This may also optimize the cost and quality of care by sharing what has or has not worked in the past. This eliminates multiple steps of trial and error regarding the same topic.

Read the following scenario about Amari and Milo. Then answer the questions that follow.
Recall from the scenario at the beginning of this chapter that Amari and Milo have noticed an increased rate of anxiety in teens within their community and that the interventions they have used previously are not eliciting the same results. To efficiently identify possible interventions for this population, they know their best option is to use evidence-based practice strategies and that they must first draft a PICOT question as the foundation for their EBP project.
Amari and Milo develop the following PICOT question: Does daily exercise have an impact on anxiety rates in adolescents compared to those who do not engage in daily exercise over three months?

Importance of Evidence-Based Decision-Making
The intent of health care is to ultimately improve client outcomes with the goal of providing the most effective care available. The EBDM process increases the objectivity of decision-making and decreases its subjectivity. Historically, health care treatments and skills relied on wisdom passed from one person to another through the form of anecdotes and demonstrations, which may be unreliable. This exemplifies a 19th-century technique by American surgeon William Stewart Halsted called “see one, do one, teach one” (Ayub, 2022). Following this philosophy, nurses should see a skill or technique being completed by another nurse, perform this skill or technique themselves, and then teach a less experienced nurse how to do the skill as needed. While this technique has been relatively effective historically and the nursing field as a whole is based on collaboration and knowledge sharing, it has flaws. If the original nurse did not perform the skill safely based on the most recent evidence, any subsequent nurses would follow the same unsafe pattern. For example, if the first nurse demonstrating insertion of a peripheral intravenous line chooses to rip the finger off their glove to touch the vein site after cleaning the identified site, each subsequent nurse may follow this unsafe process, increasing infection risks to all clients moving forward based on this inappropriate protocol. Similarly, this process relies on each nurse’s memory and the efficacy of each nurse who follows, leading to many opportunities for subjective error. Furthermore, this practice is more difficult to implement on a larger scale such as public health nursing where there is often not an opportunity to directly view a technique.
Thus, EBP and EBDM are more objective and concrete methods for finding relevant information and applying it accordingly to the current problem. In public health, EBDM is used to ensure the interventions are supported by data and thus should be effective and the interventions reach the intended population (CCHMC, 2023). It also considers the available resources within the community. Additionally, the EBDM process provides substantial support for or against certain interventions instead of continuing to practice the way it has always been done for convenience. EBDM provides a more concrete and replicable process. According to NCCMT, evidence-based decision-making in public health should consider research, community health issues (with local context), community and political preference and actions, public health resources, and the public health expertise of decision makers (NCCMT, 2023a) (). Though there may be more steps involved in EBDM than in historic methods of teaching and decision-making, this allows for the nurse to use informed and objective data to make the best and safest decision for the client (Erwin et al., 2020).

Evidence-Informed Decision-Making
The video “NCCMT - URE - Evidence Informed Decision Making - A Guiding Framework for Public Health” presents an overview of the EIDM model. It examines the five overlapping ovals depicted in the model as types of evidence used to inform decision-making. It uses the example of respiratory illness rates to show how two communities might use other sources of evidence to reach different evidence-informed decisions. Watch the video. Then respond to the following questions:
How might health inequities impact the research phase of the evidence-based decision-making process?
Discuss how the unique sources of evidence discussed in the model overlap with one another and with public health expertise.

Tools to Support Evidence-Based Decision-Making
To help with this complex process, multiple resources and tools are available to assist health care providers. A foundational understanding of the specific client, from a single person up to a whole population, is imperative to begin using these tools and resources. Though much of the information will be gathered from research, to align interventions, these tools must also connect to the designated population and the identified concern for them to prove any value in the decision-making process. Some tools and resources are designed to support clinical decisions, while others are aimed at working through the EBDM process.
Clinical decision-making support tools are available to support clinical decisions. They are formatted as resources in which health care providers can quickly look up information on clinical practices, assessments, diagnostics, and treatments. One example is UpToDate, which focuses on point-of-care utilizing EBP to make recommendations (Wolters Kluwer, 2023b). This tool provides information for all subspecialties of internal medicine to make this a user-friendly and broadly accepted tool. Another available tool is Lexicomp, which houses detailed drug information in real time (Wolters Kluwer, 2023a). These tools can help health care providers at all levels make and discuss clinical decisions to determine what is currently in practice and help determine what may need to change.
Just as there are support tools available to facilitate clinical decisions, many tools are available to assist with the multistep process of EBDM. Some tools available will help with the decision-making process to determine a searchable question, while others help with the organization and categorization of identified research articles. Resources to help users define the problem will focus on turning the identified concern into an answerable question and identifying key terms to guide an efficient search. Moving into search tools, these resources help users sift through data points and document results to track trends and highlighted usable factors. Tools for the appraisal step allow users to organize the data and appraise them accordingly. These tools have prompts and helpful formatting templates to keep appraised information organized. Synthesizing tools then help users pull out relevant information from their search and appraisal process. Adapting tools helps users evaluate the evidence for applicability and usability regarding their current concerns. Approaching the tactical aspect of the process, implementation tools help users plan for and carry out implementation based on their specific circumstance. Finally, evaluation tools and resources provide checklists of key aspects of EBDM and how to review the process that has taken place, starting at defining and moving through implementation (NCCMT, 2023b). To complete the process, there are tools that help the reflection process of the evaluation phase. For example, McMaster University’s Health Evidence website has multiple tools specifically designed for this process in the public health sector.
Tutorial: How to Use healthevidence.org
McMaster University’s Health Evidence website offers tools for evidence-informed decision-making. Examples of tools include an EIDM checklist, a resource to guide, a search tracker, and search strategies for developing a PICOT. Watch the video about using their resources. Then answer the following questions:
What are the three main methods for searching within Health Evidence?
Health Evidence is an online database that utilizes sources at which level of evidence to evaluate the effectives of public health interventions? Why is this evidence leveling important?
Articles in this database are critically appraised and rated for quality. What rating system is used in this database?
By utilizing these tools, nurses and other health care providers can make the complex process of EBDM more attainable by breaking these steps into manageable tasks.

Chapter Summary
Evidence-based practice and evidence-based decision-making are key resources to help accomplish health care goals. Evidence-based decision-making in public health is outlined by seven steps: define, search, appraise, synthesize, adapt, implement, and evaluate. The EBDM process allows for a more objective decision-making method. The first step, defining the problem, usually formatted as a PICOT question, leads the way for the rest of the process. Often, interventions outlined in research may not fit with the designated community and require adaptation. The NCCMT’s Model for evidence-based decision-making assists with this process.

By using the most recent evidence and clinical practice experience, nurses can make optimal decisions regarding policies, practices, and programs. This ensures that the care provided is based on the best available research and is tailored to the specific needs of the population being served. Additionally, EBDM helps build trust between health care providers and the public by demonstrating a commitment to using the most effective and reliable methods of care. This transparency and dedication to evidence-based practice can help foster a strong and positive relationship between health care providers and the public, as it shows a commitment to providing the best possible care. Furthermore, the dissemination of evidence-based information within the nursing community and to other health care providers or systems is crucial for advancing the field of nursing and improving overall patient care. By sharing results and best practices, nurses can collectively work towards optimizing the cost and quality of care, reducing trial and error, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. In conclusion, evidence-based decision-making is essential for providing high-quality, effective, and patient-centered care in the field of nursing and public health. It not only ensures that interventions and policies are based on the best available evidence but also helps build trust with the public and promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing within the nursing community.","nurses ma also peror the il unsafel his s where ces into l  ing the ms rce eience and clinic practice eperice nurses n a optia ecisions regarding policies practies and pors hi esures th the care provide is ased on the best availale research a is tailred to the secii es o the polation eing served dditinal, E elps build trst beteen healt care oviders and e ublic  demnstratin a commitment to usig the ost effectie nd eliale mehs of care is tnsrenc an edicatio to vidence-ased prctice an help foster a sron a positive reationshi eteen health cre providers and euc as t so a coitment t proiding te bet posse are urthermore, t dissemiation of eeceased information itin th urin conit ad to othe health care providers  sstem is crcial r aancng the ie of nsin an improving oerall patient care. y saring results and est ractices urse an colletiel or toads optimiing the cot and uality  cre rcing tial an eror and ultimaely iprovin patientoutcomes  concluion, evidencebase decisioaing s essentl for viding iualit, eecte, and atientcentere are in the field o ursin a public health t not nly enures that inteetons and olcies are be n the est aaable evidence but als hels build ts ih the pl and promotes olloration an noledeshai within t nursin comnit.",16.50485436893204,"nurses may the is where EBDM and and the is the and the the population Additionally, EBDM health and the public to the and of and to evidence-based help and health care and the to the the the and to health care providers is for the of and results and the and and and for and the of and public and are the evidence the public and and the",6.233062330623306,", evidence-based decision-making i",0.36133694670280037

Databases and Registries
With the vast amount of research available, it is crucial to be efficient while searching for relevant evidence. Databases, collections of information organized in a systematic method, are helpful during the process of searching for sources of existing literature related to the topic of one’s inquiry. Multiple databases are available to assist nurses and other health care providers through the decision-making process of selecting evidence-based interventions.  provides examples of commonly used and reliable databases.

Commonly Used Registries
Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center
As an additional means of finding EBP tools and information, the Healthy People 2030 initiative offers an EBP resource center to support health care providers, public health professionals, and policymakers in incorporating EBP interventions into their communities. These resources center on prevention, treatment, and support services for recovery in substance abuse and mental health disorders.

Data to Inform Decision-Making in Public Health
As discussed previously, public health nurses and other health care providers must consider multiple data points while searching for background and support, including surveillance, interviews, focus groups, and qualitative or quantitative research articles. While considering this information, nurses must also consider the makeup of their community and the overall functions of public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the United Nations agency dedicated to global safety and health. The WHO provides multiple sources to help nurses and other health care professionals achieve their public health goals. Within these resources, the WHO has created Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF) for population health, deemed an indispensable set of actions to achieve the goal of public health. These include the following (WHO, 2021, p. xii):
Monitoring and evaluating the population’s health status, health service utilization, and surveillance of risk factors and threats to health
Public health emergency management
Ensuring effective public health governance, regulation, and legislation
Supporting efficient and effective health systems and multisectoral planning, financing, and management for population health
Protecting populations against health threats, including environment and occupational hazards, communicable disease threats, food safety, and chemical and radiation hazards
Promoting prevention and early detection of diseases, including noncommunicable and communicable diseases
Promoting health and well-being and actions to address the wider determinants of health and inequity
Ensuring community engagement, participation, and social mobilization for health and well-being
Ensuring adequate quantity and quality of the public health workforce
Ensuring quality of and access to health services
Advancing public health research
Ensuring equitable access to and rational use of essential medicines and other health technologies
Overall, the function of public health can be summarized as monitoring the health status of the community to identify problems and hazards related to health, investigate these identified problems and hazards, and educate and empower people about the problems and hazards and what to do for optimal health (WHO, 2023). To do so, public health nurses should use their multiple forms of data to gather the best available information and apply this to program planning frameworks. This evidence may be research articles, community needs assessments, and statistics on medical risk, morbidity, mortality, and the social determinants of health.
Along with the EPHF, public health services must also be considered in decision-making. Public health is a sector of health care that seeks to protect and enhance the health of people and the communities in which they live, work, and play. To achieve this goal, the CDC has outlined 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHS) that describe the activities all communities should undertake (CDC, 2023b); see Foundations of Public/Community Health for more information. Originally published in 1994, the EPHS framework was revised in 2020. Foundationally, the 10 EPHS actively promote systems, policies, and overall environments to enable optimal health for all who seek to eradicate barriers that have resulted in health inequities. Examples of possible barriers to equity in health care are those based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, sex, disability, location, race, and ethnicity. The 10 EPHS strongly state that all members of the community should have just and fair opportunity to attain optimal health and overall well-being. The 10 EPHS center on monitoring the status of the population’s health, identifying problems for the population, and educating people accordingly about these problems. The foundations of public health center on creating policies, programs, and interventions to address these problems. Additionally, these steps help outline a pathway for nurses and other health care providers to increase equity across the population by building support and organizations to support a diverse population of clients and health care providers.
Additional considerations within the decision-making process are the social determinants of health (SDOH) and how they may impact these functions. See Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes for more information. The SDOH ultimately contribute to personal and community-wide disparities and inequities. For example, if clients lack access to stores with nutrient-rich foods or the economic means to obtain them, they are less likely to make healthier food choices, which will then likely increase their risk of conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, or heart disease. This will impact their quality of life as well as life expectancy. In the decision-making process for new programs, policies, or interventions, nurses must consider the SDOH within their community.
All of these factors must be considered in the decision-making process as they impact one another and how interventions may ultimately succeed or fail. While a public health nurse may go through the EBDM process and eventually implement a successful program in their specific community, this may not translate to other communities or populations. For example, if a nurse implements a program or intervention in their community that relies heavily on whole community participation in one physical space, this may not work well in a community where members do not feel safe or where distance and transportation are a concern. Examples of programs that help meet these public health functions are cancer prevention and screenings, behavioral risk factor surveillance systems, injury prevention campaigns, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) education and prevention programs, and smoking cessation campaigns.

Ethical and Equitable Research
If nurses cannot find the information they need, they must do their own research or data extraction to inform their decisions. It is not uncommon for public health nurses to fail to find information fitting their population as the literature often has large gaps in representation. A significant factor to consider here is research ethics. Nurses should already be familiar with the ethical codes that govern nursing practice. These ethical standards direct nursing conduct and allow for trust within the community. Similarly, there are ethical considerations related to research and those who conduct it. Research ethics employ fundamental principles guiding the design and implementation of research. These ethics center on respect for society and participants, resources, and regulation of research to prevent misconduct. These are especially important when research impacts human or animal subjects directly. In this process, there are multiple steps and checkpoints researchers need to make to follow safe channels.
The emphasis on research ethics can be traced to the National Research Act of 1974, which created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. This commission was formed to identify basic ethical principles that should inform the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects. It was also charged with developing guidelines to ensure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles (CDC, 2021). The impetus for the law and commission was the government’s discovery of unethical research and practices conducted during the U.S. Public Health Service’s Syphilis Study, known as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the natural course of untreated syphilis in Black males. Participants were not informed of the study’s true nature and thus did not give informed consent. Additionally, years into the study, penicillin became available as a treatment for syphilis yet was not offered to the men in the study (CDC, 2022; Brandt, 1978). In 1976, the commission published the Belmont Report to outline principles aimed at protecting subjects in research studies and/or clinical trials. This report outlines three basic ethical principles as well as applications for these principles. These principles include respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The applications include informed consent, assessment of risk and benefits, and selection of subjects (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], n.d.). Together, these principles work to protect participants from harm, maintain their autonomy, and distribute benefits from the research. It is important for nurses in their public health setting to obtain information regarding these steps and follow them accordingly. This may look different depending on the community setting and level of research. In addition to research ethics, equity in research is a crucial aspect to consider. Health equity means allowing everyone to have a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health. As public health considers a group of people or a community as a whole, there are many facets to consider while seeking equity of care.
Health Equity in Healthy People 2030
As Healthy People has evolved over the decades to reflect the most current science and addresses the latest public health priorities, it has strengthened its focus on health equity (USDHHS, 2023b, para.1). To find out more about Health Equity within Health People 2030, click on the link above and explore.
Equity in health research specifically means all who are affected by research and/or who may benefit from its outcomes should have an equal opportunity to contribute to the research. These equity concerns can exacerbate already-existing health dipartites. Nurses must consider their role in protecting the population within research and promoting equity in research to better serve their communities. Unfortunately, nurses and other health care providers have historically participated in unethical research and trials, leading to an even stronger urge to eliminate this in the future. One historical example is the participation of nurses and doctors in the ill-treatment and execution of tens of thousands of German citizens who were mentally, physically, and emotionally ill both before and during the Holocaust (Copeland, 2021). Another example is the role public health nurse Eunice Rivers Laurie played in the previously mentioned Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted from 1932 to 1972. Rivers worked for the study, forming a relationship with the men, providing them with transportation and hot meals, and giving them noneffective treatments. As a Black nurse, she was trusted by the men and provided continuity of care for the duration of the study (Brandt, 1978).
Interview with Tuskegee Study Nurse Eunice Rivers Laurie
This 1972 interview from National Public Radio (NPR) features Eunice Rivers Laurie, a public health nurse who worked for the Tuskegee Syphilis Study for 39 years. Laurie discusses her experience working with patients and answers questions about what patients were told. Listen to the interview, and then respond to the following questions:
What was Nurse Laurie’s role as a public health nurse in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study?
Why were the men in the study not told they had syphilis, according to Nurse Laurie?
If you had an opportunity to ask Nurse Laurie about her experience in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, what would you ask her?
Research equity in health care is imperative to improve community health and promote social change. Diverse perspectives and backgrounds must be found and utilized in research to broadly provide effective and efficient care to all. Additionally, health interventions and policies are likely to fail to meet the needs of marginalized communities if diverse populations and perspectives are not utilized. Due to the biases and perspectives of those conducting research combined with the historical lack of focus on marginalized communities in health care, there are notable gaps in information and thus solutions for these populations. Researchers must identify biases within the data they are using to support their asked question as well as the power dynamics at each step of the process to support those who may otherwise be overlooked. Accessibility must be considered within each step of the process regarding appropriate education and information sharing per population. This may mean catering to health literacy level, cultural perspectives, and/or resource availability. Foundationally, participants should receive fully transparent information regarding the intent of the research and how this information will be used. Informed consent incorporates fully transparent direction with the option to opt out at any point. As trusted care providers, nurses have a responsibility to advocate for ethical and equitable research. They have a duty to question practices they feel are not following ethical or equitable standards as well as seek to rectify these gaps in research and care. They also have a duty to obtain proper approval before conducting any of their own research and to report any researchers who violate the rights of participants.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Demonstrate an understanding of the different levels of evidence.
Describe how to evaluate a research study.

Levels of Evidence
Once evidence has been collected from the literature search discussed earlier in this chapter, the information must then be organized and categorized. To help determine the best and most accurate information available, Johns Hopkins University created the Nursing Evidence-Based Practice (JHNEBP) Model, which utilizes a three-step process for a problem-solving approach to decision-making in clinical practice. Information regarding the JHNEBP Model can be reviewed through Johns Hopkins website.
Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model
This video discusses the JHNEBP Model. Watch the video, and then respond to the questions below.
What are two goals of this model, and why are they important for implementation?
Discuss the three-phase process used in this model.
Evidence-Based Practice
Utah State University Library has created a video to help explain EBP and how it can be used in nursing and medical practice. Watch this video, and then respond to the following questions:
What are the three main elements of evidence-based practice?
Why are a client’s values and preferences a component of evidence-based practice?

Evaluating the Evidence
After understanding the levels of evidence available during the literature review, the next step is to appraise the evidence. The three main steps in evidence appraisal are identifying the type of evidence, determining the evidence level and strength, and then evaluating the quality of the evidence.
Evidence appraisal entails reviewing the acquired information and systematically reviewing its intended audience, purpose, relevance, applicability, validity, and reliability. The intended audience is the demographic that the writer or writers expect to read the information and interact with it accordingly. The purpose of an article identifies the reason for the conducted project or study. This is often identified as a purpose statement in an article. This will help quickly identify if this article will help answer the question posed by research. Furthermore, the article should be reviewed for relevance, meaning how close the source’s elements are to the current question and if the results can be applied to the population in question. This applicability, or how well the results and data can pertain to broad or specific population, is an important piece of appraisal. Validity is how factual the information within the article is. This is sometimes referred to as accuracy or credibility in research articles. Correspondingly, reliability is the extent to which results can be reproduced if research is completed under the same conditions. An easy way to think about reliability is how well someone or a group may reproduce the same results if they followed the same steps outlined in a research article.  demonstrates the search pyramid tools researchers use to rank their evidence and use accordingly. Each level of evidence pulls from the research obtained at lower levels, meaning the highest and most synthesized information is within evidence at the top of the pyramid. Evidence from the highest level of the decision pyramid should be used first to compile the highest and most effective evidence.
The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools provides the 6S search pyramid outlining evidence from the lowest to the highest level. (See National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, 2023c; attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Part C
Amari and Milo have used the research databases and found four quantitative studies and three qualitative studies regarding exercise and mental health. Additionally, they surveyed the community to identify components of community exercise programs. This survey included physical locations, cost, and general attendance of these classes and programs. They also spoke with the local school systems to determine how physical education is incorporated into the high school curriculum. Amari and Milo must now appraise the evidence in order to select which data points to use and to what degree.
Answer the following questions based on the case information provided in the chapter thus far.
Minority Representation in Medical Research
This PBS video outlines gaps in representation of racial and ethnic groups within clinical trials and medical research. This ultimately limits the amount of information available about diverse populations, which can skew perspectives on care. Nurses in public health must understand these inequities and find ways to combat these gaps. Watch the video, and then respond to the questions below.
How can public health nurses help mitigate the discrepancies in representation currently seen in medical trials and research?
Reverend Alvin Hathaway states, “That’s not really bias, that’s just accessibility” when discussing funding slanted toward a European data set. What does this mean? How can public health nurses help to broaden this data set?
Each article or source identified in the literature review of a project should be appraised considering the aspects discussed above. The Johns Hopkin Toolkit provides a guide to evidence level and quality, which can facilitate this process. Once this appraisal has been completed, the sources can be categorized and ranked to determine which ones may be helpful to use as a foundation for the research ahead. Nurses should use this process to identify strong research that can support the outcomes of their EBP intervention.
Throughout this chapter, Amari and Milo have been applying the EBDM process to a concern in their community. This segment reveals the outcome of their process. Read the scenario, and then respond to the following questions.
After synthesizing the data, Amari and Milo note that consistent interventions discussed to support mental health in adolescents are regular exercise, appropriate sleep, and relaxation techniques. Specifically, the literature supported structured exercise classes and group movement as a successful method to reduce adolescent anxiety.
While the search supported specific interventions, as public health nurses, Amari and Milo know they need to also take into consideration the NCCMT Model for the evidence-based decision-making as it incorporates research, community health issues in the local context, community and political preferences and actions, public health resources, and public health expertise. With that, their assessment notes the limited access to workout facilities such as public gyms for many of the adolescents in the community. Additionally, they note a high price for membership compared to the average family income. They are also aware that many adolescents in the community work to help support themselves and their families. This not only limits their time availability but also speaks to the additional monetary strain. Also, after speaking to the public school system, they note physical education classes are optional for high school juniors and seniors. They find many students opt out of this class as their other option is early release or study hall.
Due to all these factors, the nurses identify that although the literature is clear on a specific intervention for exercise, it may not be the best option for their current community. As EBDM allows for flexibility in priority of data points, this is an appropriate realization. Instead, the two decide they can still implement interventions for daily exercise that consider these community factors.
This leads them to the adapt phase. They decide to implement the following interventions:
Offering free daily classes at the community health center lead by volunteers. These classes will be offered at two different times each day and will be available to all adolescents within the community.
Compiling a list of free exercise resources on the health department website that adolescents can use directly by streaming them at home, if possible, or in the community center with free internet. Additionally, Amari and Milo have worked with the high school and obtained support for two computers to be used for this resources that will be available for students during their study hall.
Each participant who attends a class will sign in to track use of this resource. Those who access the electronic resources will have a unique log-in passcode. These will be used to track the amount of exercise over three months for each participant. This data will then be looked at in comparison to the level of anxiety reported by adolescents in the community.
After three months of implementation, Amari and Milo review the rates of exercise and rates of anxiety for adolescents in the community. They find a decrease in anxiety for those who participated in exercise at least five times a week. Due to these results, the nurses begin brainstorming how they can expand these interventions. They will support daily exercise but note activity at least five days a week helps reduce anxiety. They plan to obtain data for three more months and then disseminate their results at that time.
Identify and discuss the last step in the public health decision-making process. What takes place during this step, and why is it important?
Do you agree with the implemented interventions? Why or why not?
What other interventions would you propose? How would you ensure your recommendations are evidence-based? Provide at least two alternative interventions with resources cited for support.
Chapter Summary
Taking the necessary steps to evaluate the quality of each piece of evidence ensures that each adds value to the project and helps meet the user’s needs and expectations. This process may also help identify gaps in what has previously been researched and/or implemented. Evaluating the quality of the evidence involves reviewing the acquired information and systematically reviewing its intended audience, purpose, relevance, applicability, validity, and reliability.

A Closer Look at Health Promotion
Organizations define health promotion in different ways. The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, described in detail later in this chapter, offers the most widely accepted description of health promotion:
Health promotion is the process of empowering people to increase control over, and to improve, their health (World Health Organization [WHO], 1986). This must involve addressing physical, mental, and social well-being. In order to accomplish health promotion, an individual or group must be able to identify and realize goals related to health, satisfy needs, and change or cope with the environment. Health, according to the WHO (1986), should be seen not as the objective of living but instead as a resource for everyday life. Clearly, health promotion is a responsibility of the health sector. Sectors are critical, distinct parts of society. We must view health promotion as not just the responsibility of the health sector but as an obligation of multiple sectors, such as the environmental, educational, and technological sectors as well as others (WHO, 1986, para. 1).
The process of health promotion includes activities for individuals, the community at large, or for populations at increased risk of negative health outcomes. Health promotion is empowering for individuals and communities, and it can be used in both active and passive ways. For instance, adding fluoride to public drinking water is a passive form of health promotion at the community level. Brushing teeth and getting regular dental assessments are active forms of health promotion at the individual level.
Health Promotion Behaviors
Health promotion behaviors aim to improve the well-being, mental health, and quality of life of individuals and communities (Walker et al., 1995) (see ). There are six dimensions of health promotion behaviors that describe certain behaviors by which a person engages with their health. These dimensions empower (or not) a person’s control over and improvement of their health.

Six Dimensions of Health Promotion Behavior (See Walker et al., 1995.)
Nurses’ Role in Health Promotion
As mentioned above, health promotion is often an intersectoral endeavor (WHO, 2023a)—that is, one that involves several sectors of society and that can occur within or outside of the health care sector. Actions taken by health, education, housing, and local government sectors collaborating to enhance population health use an intersectoral approach (Oxford, 2023). Because nurses can serve in a variety of roles in interprofessional practice, including care provider, educator, consultant, and advocate, they are in a unique position to contribute to intersectoral collaboration. Health promotion can involve the following:
Assisting a client in developing personal health promotion behavior skills (individual)
Assisting the community in strengthening actions to achieve better health (community)
Creating supportive environments within society (population or public as a whole)
Advocating for the adoption of public health policies (population or public as a whole)
Throughout the health promotion process, as nurses assist clients in developing personal health promotion behavior skills, they serve as care providers and educators. Assessment data may indicate the need to develop a client’s personal health promotion behaviors. The nurse assumes the role of educator during the implementation stage. Effective education for change requires the nurse to have a good grasp of evidence-based practice and other scientific knowledge as well as educational theory, the teaching-learning process, and models specifically related to health behavior change (see Theories and Models). The nurse must support individual, and therefore social, development by educating, informing, and improving clients’ life skills (WHO, 2023c). When a client is informed and knowledgeable, they have the ability to make choices that can positively influence their health and their environment (WHO, 2023c). The nurse educates the client about their current situation and provides anticipatory guidance to help them meet and cope with health challenges as they move through the stages of the lifespan (WHO, 2023c). The role of the nurse as an educator is one of the most critical roles in health promotion. The nurse may also need to serve as educator in order to create supportive environments for health.
The nurse serves as consultant and advocate by performing community health promotion activities. Such activities strengthen clients’ actions to achieve better health, resulting in environments that support better health (Iriarte-Roteta et al., 2020). A community is complex, frequently changing, and made up of interconnecting parts from which health cannot be separated. Planners can seek input from a public health nurse to understand the health and illness experiences of the community and implement beneficial changes for community health (American Public Health Association [APHA], 2022). For instance, a city council may request input from a public health nurse prior to installing a new splash park for children.
Nurses have a responsibility to advocate for access to health care, health promotion, disease prevention, and any other health-related issues. A variety of professional groups, including the American Nurses Association (ANA, 2015), the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2021), and the International Council of Nurses (2021), support the nurse’s role as policy advocate. According to the ANA (n.d.), “Advocacy is a pillar of nursing.”

A Closer Look at Disease Prevention
Disease prevention involves undertaking specific population- and individual-based interventions geared toward decreasing the burden of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases and their associated risk factors (WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2023). The hallmark of communicable diseases is that they spread from one person to another, from an animal to a person, or from a surface or a food to a person (CDC, 2022). They may include pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks, vaccine-preventable diseases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB), and others. See Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks. The CDC (2022) broadly defines noncommunicable diseases as chronic conditions that do not result from an acute or infectious process. Chronic diseases are those that meet one or both of the following criteria: a disease that lasts one year or longer and requires ongoing medical attention; a disease that limits the activities of daily living. Noncommunicable diseases include chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and others, as discussed in The Health of the Population.
Preventive Care
Another term for disease prevention is preventive care. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, n.d.), preventive care involves routine health care screenings, check-ups, immunizations, and counseling to prevent illness, disease, or health-related problems. Healthy People 2030: Preventive Care gives examples and connects preventive care to the Healthy People 2030 Objectives, as described in detail in Planning Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions.
Preventive Care
Healthy People 2030 Preventive Care Objectives focus on a broad range of goals, such as increasing the number of community health organizations that offer prevention services; increasing screening for various forms of cancer, depression, newborn hearing, and osteoporosis; promoting vaccinations; and increasing health care access and quality. Other topics include heart disease and stroke, oral health, pregnancy and childbirth, sensory or communication disorders, and sexually transmitted infections.
Nurses’ Role in Disease Prevention
Nurses play an enormous role in disease prevention. The nurse’s role as educator is especially important to prevention, as nurses are qualified to provide information, training, and education about a range of health-related, preventive topics. When people are educated about health behaviors, they experience better health outcomes (Zajacova & Lawrence, 2018).
The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP, 2023), a branch of the CDC, indicates that 6 in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic disease. These largely preventable diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. For instance, tobacco use can lead to several forms of cancer. Diets high in sodium can lead to hypertension. Preventive care such as smoking cessation and dietary education can help prevent these chronic diseases from occurring. Nurses can educate their clients about these and other disease-preventing behavior changes. Recall Deanna from the case scenario. The nurse at the community health screening helped to identify a potential chronic health problem for Deanna and then provided Deanna with information she could use to help prevent the development or progression of hypertension.
Nurses apply evidence-based practice to prevent disease (see Evidence-Based Practice). Using evidence from correlational or causal studies to examine the relationships between diseases and behaviors or risks for these diseases, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2021) makes recommendations about the effectiveness of clinical primary and secondary preventive services based on available evidence. These recommendations inform effective nursing practice. For example, nurses may inform clients of USPSTF recommendations for colorectal cancer screenings in adults and older adults, tobacco smoking cessation in adults, and the use of folic acid in pregnant persons for the prevention of neural tube defects.

For example, nurses may inform clients of USPSTF recommendations for colorectal cancer screenings in adults and older adults, tobacco smoking cessation in adults, and the use of folic acid in pregnant persons for the prevention of neural tube defects.

The Distinction Between Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
While the functions of health promotion and disease prevention overlap and they share many goals, there are differences between the two. Disease prevention focuses on specific efforts at reducing the development and severity of chronic diseases and other morbidities. While health promotion efforts can lead to such a reduction, health promotion can also occur unlinked to disease and simply be used to promote overall well-being. Some examples of health promotion that is unlinked to prevention of a specific disease may include the following:
Physical activity campaigns to encourage regular exercise
Nutrition education regarding balanced diets and portion control
Stress management workshops to enhance mental well-being
Workplace wellness programs to support employees’ physical and mental health
Smoking cessation programs to promote a smoke-free environment
Mental health awareness campaigns to reduce stigma
Environmental health initiatives to promote clean air, clean water, and safe living
Another distinction between health promotion and disease prevention is related to the strategies used for each. Health promotion interventions often involve education, awareness campaigns, behavior change programs, and community engagement to encourage healthy behaviors and create supportive environments for health. On the other hand, disease prevention strategies more specifically target known risk factors or disease processes.
Another distinction often occurs at the conceptual level. In this case, health promotion is primarily concerned with the social determinants of health (SDOH) (WHO, 2023a). SDOH, as described in Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes, are “the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks” (USDHHS, n.d.c). Therefore, various sectors typically collaborate with the health care sector to contribute to addressing SDOH. For example, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (2023) describes the collaboration of the governmental sector (policy development), the tobacco manufacturing sector, the education sector, and the health care sector in combating tobacco use. Disease prevention, in contrast, has primarily been concentrated within the health care sector (WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2023).

Chapter Summary
Health promotion and disease prevention are overlapping yet distinct processes. Both are foundational principles that guide the Healthy People 2030 initiative. Best defined by the Ottawa Charter, health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. The six dimensions of health promotion behaviors include responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth, and stress management. Disease prevention involves undertaking specific interventions geared toward decreasing the burden of disease and its associated risk factors. Preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, check-ups, and counseling, are a large portion of prevention. Nurses play an important role in both health promotion and disease prevention.

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe the five key action areas of health promotion as defined in the Ottawa Charter.
Describe the natural history of a disease to identify opportunities for prevention and control.
Apply the four levels of prevention (primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary) to plan health promotion and disease prevention interventions.

Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, 1986
The first International Conference on Health Promotion in Ottawa, Canada, in 1986 produced the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion with the aim of achieving (or establishing) more effective health education strategies (WHO, 2023a). The Charter provided a common definition of health promotion, three core values, a framework of three strategies, and five areas of action. The nurse plays an important role in each of these.
The Ottawa Charter
This video describes the Ottawa Charter, a landmark document that was influential in providing guidance to the goals and concepts of health promotion for public and population health programs worldwide.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
Which action area in the Ottawa Charter links most closely to the SDOH we address today?
How can the nurse participate in each of the three strategies for health promotion identified by the Ottawa Charter?

The Natural History of Disease
To identify opportunities for prevention and control, it is first necessary to recognize the natural history of disease—that is, the progression of a disease process in an individual over time in the absence of treatment (Kisling et al., 2023). The five stages in the natural history of disease are underlying, susceptible, subclinical, clinical, and recovery/disability/death. (See .)
Stage
Definition
Example
Underlying
Risk factors may lead to the development of a disease. These can include social and environmental factors.
A client who is sedentary for over eight hours daily is at risk for developing obesity. Therefore, the client is in the underlying stage of disease.
Susceptible
The state of being predisposed to, or sensitive to, developing a certain disease. Genetic, environmental, or a combination of both factors may contribute to this.
A client who lives in a region with very poor air quality is more susceptible to developing lung disease due to their environment.
Subclinical
An illness that stays below the surface of clinical detection and has no recognizable clinical findings. In infectious diseases, this is the incubation period, or the time from exposure to onset of disease symptoms. The clinical latency period is the period for which an infection is subclinical.
The results of routine bloodwork indicate a client has hypothyroidism. They have difficulty believing they have a thyroid problem because a relative with hypothyroidism gained weight, lost their hair, and experienced constipation. The client has none of these symptoms because they are in the subclinical stage of disease.
Clinical
A disease with recognizable clinical signs and symptoms.
The client’s relative in the above (subclinical) example is in the clinical stage of hypothyroidism.
Recovery/Disability/Death
Ultimately, a disease process ends in either recovery, disability, or death.
A client has an untreated infection with HIV. This terminates with AIDS and death over a ten-year period.
Five Stages in the Natural History of Disease (See Kisling et al., 2023.)
Recognition of each of the stages of disease allows the nurse to identify the corresponding levels of prevention, which can then be applied to plan health promotion and disease prevention interventions.

Levels of Prevention
The five levels of prevention—primordial, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary—described in Foundations of Public/Community Health correspond to the five stages of disease described in . Combined use of prevention strategies in a community at the macro-level (or upstream) can lead to the prevention of individual (micro-level, or downstream) complications of an exhibited disease (Kisling & Das, 2022).  looks at the levels of prevention as they correspond to the disease stages.
Five Levels of Prevention
Levels of Prevention
Targeted Stage of Disease
Characteristics of Level of Prevention
Example of Level of Prevention
Primordial Prevention
Underlying
Risk factor reduction targeted to an entire population through focus on social and environmental conditions
Prevention of the development of risk factors for disease
Typically promoted through laws and policy (multi-sectoral)
Often aimed at children to decrease as much risk exposure as possible
Targets the underlying social conditions that promote disease onset
Improving an urban neighborhood’s access to safe sidewalks to promote physical activity, which in turn will decrease risk factors for obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes
Primary Prevention
Susceptible
To prevent a disease from occurring
Target population is healthy individuals
Modifies existing risk factors to prevent the development of disease
Commonly involves activities to limit risk exposure or increase immunity of those at risk to prevent a disease from progressing in a susceptible individual to subclinical disease
Conducting an immunization campaign targeting school-aged children, with the goal of preventing the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases and promoting overall community health
Secondary Prevention
Subclinical
Emphasizes early disease detection
Targets healthy-appearing individuals with subclinical forms of disease
Organizing a breast cancer screening program in collaboration with local community organizations, such as women's groups and senior centers, to raise awareness about the importance of screenings and encourage women to participate
Tertiary Prevention
Clinical
Recovery,
    Disability,
    Death
Targets both the clinical and outcomes stages of disease
Implemented in symptomatic individuals
Aims to reduce the severity of disease and any associated sequelae
Referring community members who live with chronic joint pain and limited mobility to a local rehabilitation center, which serves as a community hub for rehabilitation service activities that encourage community members to engage with one another, share experiences, and provide mutual support throughout their rehabilitation journey
Quaternary Prevention
N/A
Targets clients with illness but without disease
Action taken to protect persons from medical interventions that are likely to cause more harm than good
Cautioning a population of clients who are complete post-hysterectomy against the continuing need for Pap smears
Vaccination
Healthy People 2030 vaccination objectives focus on increasing the proportion of children and adults who receive recommended vaccinations and maintain vaccination coverage. This objective category includes recommendations for reducing the number of children who do not get recommended vaccines by age 2 in order to reduce outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, pertussis, and mumps.
While primordial and primary prevention appear similar, a key to differentiating them involves the actual existence of risk factors. Primordial prevention prevents the development of risk factors for disease. Primary prevention modifies existing risk factors to prevent the development of disease (Weintraub et al., 2011). In addition, primordial prevention generally is intersectoral rather than limited to those within the health sector. The other levels of prevention, as noted previously, are mainly limited to the health sector. This information can be useful to the nurse as they plan health promotion and disease prevention interventions.
Another important factor the nurse should consider when planning involves the approach to prevention. The high-risk approach targets prevention only to those who are identified to be at high risk for disease. This could be an individual or a group who is likely to have an increased incidence of a disease based on the presence of known risk factors for the disease or characteristics that are associated with a higher incidence of disease. Even when a group is involved, the high-risk approach focuses on the individual and their risk behaviors (Wilson et al., 2017). An example of this approach would be a smoking cessation intervention for a client.
In contrast, a population approach implements prevention strategies across an entire population, many of whom are not necessarily at high risk (Rose, 1992). An example of a population approach to prevention would be a citywide anti-smoking law inside public buildings. In most cases, a population approach requires intersectoral involvement, while the high-risk approach is usually limited to the health sector. Both approaches can be used at the primary and secondary prevention levels (Platt et al., 2017). Sometimes a combination of both approaches is used to prevent disease.
Levels of Disease Prevention
To address disease prevention as a whole, it is necessary to look at different levels of prevention as they apply to population health. The video “Levels of Disease Prevention and Approaches” reviews the definition of prevention, the process of prevention, the four levels of prevention, and two approaches to prevention. Watch the video, and then respond to the questions below.
A client at risk for diabetes has their blood glucose and HgA1C levels tested periodically. Which level of prevention does this describe?
A public health nurse provides a presentation on healthy eating habits to first-grade children. Which level of prevention does this describe?
Part A: Health Screening Follow-Up
Read the scenario, and then answer the questions that follow.
After receiving education from the nurse at the community health screening, Deanna decides to call and make an appointment with her primary provider to follow up on the high blood pressure reading. The receptionist at the provider’s office provides Deanna with an appointment in a week, noting Deanna’s reason for the visit is “BP 148/88 at community screening, denies other symptoms.” The nurse in the provider’s office reviews Deanna’s file in preparation for the office visit. The nurse notes that Deanna has not seen the provider for a few years, has no high blood pressure readings documented in the past, and has a family history of hypertension.

Chapter Summary
Nurses select and perform health promotion and disease prevention interventions at the individual and community levels. The nurse can use the five key action areas of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion to guide interventions. To appropriately apply interventions, nurses must understand the stages of disease and their corresponding levels of prevention, which can lead to disease risk reduction and prevention of complications of a current disease.

Primordial prevention targets the underlying risk factors for disease and focuses on social and environmental conditions at the population level. Primary prevention aims to prevent the occurrence of a disease in healthy individuals, while secondary prevention emphasizes early disease detection in subclinical individuals. Tertiary prevention targets both the clinical stage of disease and its outcomes, aiming to reduce the severity of the disease and its associated sequelae. Additionally, the nurse should consider the approach to prevention, which can be high-risk or population-based. The high-risk approach focuses on individuals or groups identified to be at high risk for disease, while the population approach implements prevention strategies across an entire population, regardless of individual risk. Both approaches can be used at the primary and secondary prevention levels, and a combination of both approaches is sometimes used to effectively prevent disease. Understanding these levels of prevention and approaches to prevention is essential for nurses to plan and implement comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention interventions.","health. ioia revention ares the deinito free  ocss o evention the ou level  prevention as to prevent the oren o  ise in at idias hil send evetese ealy iee eetion i sublical nvids a preention tagts o te clnicle of disese a t ceing o ed the seri  the ase  is aote eeedtion the nurse houl cnide te appoh  prveto w n e high o puain.

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe health promotion models at the systems level that can guide the identification, development, and implementation of interventions.
Describe health promotion models and theories at the intrapersonal level that can guide the identification, development, and implementation of interventions.
Describe health promotion models and theories at the interpersonal level that can guide the identification, development, and implementation of interventions.
Utilize a theory or model to guide the identification, development, and implementation of interventions.

Applying a Systems Perspective to Health Promotion
There are different levels of influence that can affect health behavior. Recall Deanna in the case scenario. After receiving the blood pressure reading at the community health screening, Deanna may delay going to her provider for an annual exam. At the intrapersonal (individual) level, Deanna may have been stressed about the blood pressure reading, which she knows may increase her blood pressure even more, so this inaction may be due to fears of what the exam will reveal. At the interpersonal level, Deanna’s friends like to engage in regular exercise. This would be a positive factor, encouraging Deanna to participate in healthy activities. At the institutional level, scheduling an appointment may be difficult due to limited office hours. At the public policy level, Deanna may lack insurance coverage and have difficulty affording the appointment’s cost. The outcome of the individual avoiding an annual exam and potentially negatively affecting their health may result from every level of influence.

Theories and Models at the Intrapersonal, Interpersonal, and Community Levels
This section examines theories and their applications at the individual (intrapersonal), interpersonal, and community levels of the socio-ecological perspective (see Socio-ecological Perspectives and Health). At the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels, these theories can be broadly categorized as cognitive-behavioral theories, which have three common concepts (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 12):
Behavior is mediated by cognition. In other words, what people know and think affects how they act.
Knowledge is necessary for but not sufficient to produce most behavior changes.
Perceptions, motivations, skills, and the social environment are key influences on behavior.
Community-level models “offer frameworks for implementing multi-dimensional approaches to promote healthy behaviors” (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 12) and complement education by providing efforts to change the social and physical environment in hopes of supporting positive behavior changes.
Individual or Intrapersonal Level
The individual level is the most basic level of health promotion and disease prevention. Individual behavior is the most fundamental unit of group behavior; therefore, individual-level or intrapersonal-level influence is necessary to promote behavior change at the larger levels. Intrapersonal-level theories focus on intrapersonal factors, which are those existing or occurring within the individual self or mind. These factors include knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, motivation, self-concept, developmental history, past experiences, and skills.
The Health Belief Model (HBM) focuses on an individual’s perceptions of the threat posed by a health problem, the benefits of avoiding the threat, and factors that influence the decision to act. The threat could be related to susceptibility or severity, and factors influencing the decision to act could involve barriers, cues to action, or self-efficacy. One of the first theories of health behavior, the HBM was developed in the 1950s through the U.S. Public Health Service to explain why so few people were participating in free, government-supported programs to prevent and detect disease. The HBM (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 13) indicates that an individual is ready to act regarding their health if six constructs are in place (see ).
The six constructs provide a beneficial framework for designing short-term and long-term behavior change strategies in individuals. They can also be used to design or adapt health promotion or disease prevention programs for groups. The HBM may be used alone or in combination with other theories or models.

(See National Cancer Institute, 2005.)
Another theory that can be used at the intrapersonal level for health promotion and prevention is the Stages of Change, or Transtheoretical, Model. This model is based on the premise that behavior change is a process, not an event, and as a person attempts to change a behavior, they move through five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. These are described further in Socio-ecological Perspectives and Health. An example of how this model may be applied is the CDC (2017) fact sheet “Talking about Fall Prevention with Your Patients” that describes strategies for matching fall prevention advice to a client’s stage of readiness.
The Transtheoretical Model
The podcast Lifestyle and Behavior Change provides a discussion of how the Transtheoretical Model can be used when performing health coaching for lifestyle and behavior change. Listen to the podcast or read the transcript, and then respond to the following questions:
Which stage of the Transtheoretical Model is the focus of the podcast?
What are some specific examples of health coaching in public health?
Interpersonal Level
At the interpersonal level, “theories of health behavior assume individuals exist within, and are influenced by, a social environment” (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 19). The social environment can include anyone with whom an individual interacts, such as family, friends, coworkers, health professionals, and others. The opinions, thoughts, behaviors, advice, and support of these people influence the individual’s feelings and behavior, and the individual has an equal effect on these people.
The Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is the most frequently used example of an interpersonal model. SCT describes the influence of experiences, actions of others, and environmental factors on an individual’s health behaviors. Three main factors that affect the likelihood that a person will change a health behavior, according to the SCT, are self-efficacy, goals, and outcome expectancies. SCT includes six constructs, described in .
Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)
Construct

(See National Cancer Institute, 2005.)
HoMBReS
HoMBReS is a community-based intervention designed to reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among Latino men living in rural areas of the United States. The program is based on the SCT and trains “navegantes” (navigators) who provide information and risk reduction materials to the target population.
 Read about HoMBReS, and then respond to the following questions:
What is the environment in which HoMBReS is delivered?
Which construct of SCT does HoMBReS seem to primarily focus on?
Community Level
Communities are at the heart of public health promotion and disease prevention. Community-level models explore how social systems function and change and how to activate community members and organizations. Models using community-level strategies can be used in numerous settings, including health care institutions, schools, workplaces, community groups, and government agencies. These models use the ecological perspective, as described in Socio-ecological Perspectives and Health, addressing individual, group, institutional, and community issues (National Cancer Institute, 2005).
One of the most frequently used community-level models is the Diffusion of Innovations Theory. It addresses how new ideas, products, and social practices spread within an organization, community, or society or from one society to another (National Cancer Institute, 2005). Diffusion of Innovations is “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system” (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 27). These four central concepts are defined in .
Concepts in Diffusion of Innovations
Concept
Definition
Innovation
An idea, object, or practice that is thought to be new by an individual, organization, or community
Communication channels

How long it takes to adopt the innovation
(See National Cancer Institute, 2005.)
Diffusions of Innovations as it relates to health promotion and disease prevention requires a multilevel change process. At the individual or intrapersonal level, adopting a health behavior innovation usually involves lifestyle change. At the organizational or interpersonal level, it may involve starting programs, changing regulations, or altering roles. At the community level, the media, policies, or beginning initiatives may be involved. Several factors, seen in , determine how quickly and to what extent an innovation will be adopted and diffused. When considering the benefits of an innovation, these attributes can help health care professionals position it most effectively.
Key Attributes Affecting an Innovation’s Diffusion
Attribute
Key Question
Relative advantage
Is the innovation better than what it will replace?
Compatibility
Does the innovation fit with the intended audience?
Complexity
Is the innovation easy to use?
Trialability
Can the innovation be tried before making a decision to adopt?
Observability
Are the results of the innovation observable and easily measurable?
(See National Cancer Institute, 2005.)
The Diffusion of Innovation Theory also involves categories of adopters, seen in . By identifying the characteristics of people in each adopter category, health care professionals can more effectively plan and implement strategies customized to their needs (National Cancer Institute, 2005).
Adopter Categories in Diffusion of Innovations Theory
Category of Adopter
Characteristics
Innovators
They want to be the first to try the innovation.They are interested in new ideas and challenges and are willing to take risks.
Early Adopters
They tend to be opinion leaders in a social system and have influence over the decisions of others.They are already aware of the need for change, so they are comfortable adopting new ideas.
Early Majority
They are rarely leaders, but they adopt new ideas before the average person.They typically need to see evidence that the innovation works before they are willing to adopt it.
Late Majority
They are skeptical of change.They will adopt an innovation only after the majority has tried it.
Laggards
They are very skeptical of change.They are the hardest group to persuade to adopt an innovation.
(See Ohkubo et al., 2015.)
The Diffusion of Innovations Theory combines all of these elements to guide the health care professional in providing health promotion and disease prevention efforts. For example, a local university designs a program for the county public school system to decrease obesity in elementary school students. In the classroom, students learn about healthy foods, nutrition, and reading nutrition labels. The school cafeteria provides sample lunch menus with nutrition information. In physical education classes, students learn how different physical activities contribute to healthy living. After a few years, the program is considered a success. Program participants continued to have healthier habits than children who graduated before the program began.
The program’s success, however, is not enough. To broaden its impact, diffusion is necessary. The program’s relative advantage could be demonstrated to other school district leaders. The program’s compatibility could be demonstrated by illustrating how it meets national and state standards for health and physical education. Complexity could be addressed with teaching toolkits that make content easily accessible to educators. Interested educators could access free sample teaching materials via a website for trialability. Finally, observability could be provided via a video on the same website for demonstration purposes. Once adopted by another school district, leadership at the district could use the categories of adopters to roll out the program to educators.

Individual or Intrapersonal Level
The individual level is the most basic level of health promotion and disease prevention. Individual behavior is the most fundamental unit of group behavior; therefore, individual-level or intrapersonal-level influence is necessary to promote behavior change at the larger levels. Intrapersonal-level theories focus on intrapersonal factors, which are those existing or occurring within the individual self or mind. These factors include knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, motivation, self-concept, developmental history, past experiences, and skills.

They are very skeptical of change.They are the hardest group to persuade to adopt an innovation.
(See Ohkubo et al., 2015.)
The Diffusion of Innovations Theory combines all of these elements to guide the health care professional in providing health promotion and disease prevention efforts. For example, a local university designs a program for the county public school system to decrease obesity in elementary school students. In the classroom, students learn about healthy foods, nutrition, and reading nutrition labels. The school cafeteria provides sample lunch menus with nutrition information. In physical education classes, students learn how different physical activities contribute to healthy living. After a few years, the program is considered a success. Program participants continued to have healthier habits than children who graduated before the program began.
The program’s success, however, is not enough. To broaden its impact, diffusion is necessary. The program’s relative advantage could be demonstrated to other school district leaders. The program’s compatibility could be demonstrated by illustrating how it meets national and state standards for health and physical education. Complexity could be addressed with teaching toolkits that make content easily accessible to educators. Interested educators could access free sample teaching materials via a website for trialability. Finally, observability could be provided via a video on the same website for demonstration purposes. Once adopted by another school district, leadership at the district could use the categories of adopters to roll out the program to educators.

Chapter Summary
Nurses and other health care professionals need frameworks to support the practice of health promotion and disease prevention. Various levels of such frameworks are necessary in order to provide appropriate guidance. The ecological perspective is an overarching approach to both health promotion and disease prevention at the systems level. The CDC developed its socio-ecological model from the ecological perspective as a framework for its health promotion programs. A variety of theories and models exist at the individual (intrapersonal), interpersonal, and community levels. The Health Belief Model (HBM), Stages of Change (Transtheoretical) Model, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), and Diffusion of Innovations Theory are described, and examples of the frameworks in action are provided.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe barriers that negatively impact health outcomes.
Examine factors that influence participation in health promotion activities.
Recognize opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention across health care settings.
Explain how systems can serve as barriers to effective disease prevention and health promotion.

Barriers to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
It is necessary to be aware of barriers to plan to overcome them for clients or populations. These include barriers to economic stability, access to high-quality education, and access to quality health care. Other barriers are related to neighborhood and built environment and to social and community contexts. These barriers can also contribute to health disparities, as described in Health Disparities. As discussed, the SDOH are barriers that can prevent an individual from obtaining the resources they need to achieve better health outcomes and improved quality of life (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, 2020). (See Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes.)  provides individual and system-level examples of barriers to health promotion and disease prevention that may occur within each area of the SDOH.
SDOH as Barriers to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)
Example of an Individual-Level Barrier
Example of a System-Level Barrier
Economic Stability
A client’s primary provider instructs them to follow a low-sodium diet. The client will not receive a paycheck until Friday and only has $30 for the next two days. Rather than choose a salad from the grocery, the client chooses a fast-food meal to make the money they have last longer.
A client lives in a rental apartment in a community with little stable housing. The client has recently been experiencing respiratory difficulties. A neighbor reported mold in their building due to frequent water leaks. The client’s primary provider is concerned that the apartment may be contributing to the client’s respiratory condition. The client can barely afford the apartment and cannot afford to move.
Education Access and Quality
An individual with limited English proficiency has chest pain. Because they are not sure they can describe their symptoms, they choose to rest at home rather than seek health care.
A child is enrolled in a low-quality school with limited health resources, multiple safety concerns, and low teacher support. The child is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and requires insulin injections twice during the school day. There is no school nurse.
Health Care Access and Quality
A client who does not drive lives in a rural area. She has an appointment for a mammogram two hours away. She has arranged for her grandchild to drive her to the appointment. Unfortunately, the grandchild’s vehicle is unreliable and is not drivable on the day of the appointment.
An urban clinic has experienced a shortage of providers following the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in clients experiencing longer wait times and delayed care.
Neighborhood and Built Environment
A client is diagnosed with obesity and instructed by their primary provider to walk 30 minutes daily. The client lives in an urban area with a high crime rate. The only available walking locations are the city streets and a dimly lit park known for drug dealing and use. The client works 12-hour daytime shifts, so the only time they can walk is after dark.
An older adult client relies on a neighbor to perform weekly grocery shopping. The neighbor does not have a car and walks to the closest nearby store, approximately 1 mile away. The store has no fresh produce and is not a chain supermarket. A convenience store within a gas station is the only other store within walking distance. The client would like fresh fruits and vegetables, but these are unavailable.
Social and Community Context
A transgender teenager suffers from depression due to bullying at school. They experience social rejection and isolation, decreased social support, and verbal abuse daily.
A family of color lives in a neighborhood that has historically been ignored for social improvements by the city government. The family’s children were all considered small-for-gestational-age births.
The experience of structural racism results in chronic discrimination, stress, and depression, which has a further negative impact on the ability of those within historically marginalized populations and can create a further barrier to health promotion and disease prevention (Churchwell et al., 2020). One particular form of a barrier to health outcomes has already been discussed in Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated this point:
Black, Hispanic, and Latino people; American Indians/Alaska Natives; and Pacific Islanders had a higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rate than White people.
Counties that had over 45 percent of residents belonging to a historically oppressed group recorded higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality compared to counties with mostly White residents regardless of the county’s poverty level.
During the pandemic, there was a rise in anxiety and depression; studies show that Hispanic and Latino adults (22 percent) and Black adults (18 percent) experienced a higher rate of substance use initiation or increase than White adults (11 percent) during this time (Churchwell et al., 2020).
As individuals and populations encounter these many barriers to health promotion and disease prevention, health outcomes begin to decline. Overcoming these barriers is the only way to successfully achieve positive health outcomes, as an individual or a population.

Barriers to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Within a Health Care Delivery System
The structure of health care delivery systems is made up of internal and external factors that can influence health promotion and disease prevention, therefore impacting health outcomes. Internal factors include everything within the environment in which health care services are provided as well as the resources required for providing those services. These include, but are not limited to, leadership styles, organizational culture, policies and procedures, and information sharing. External factors include government’s role in health care, community expectations and influences, ownership of the health care system, and the extent of services the system provides.
A nurse serving in a role related to health promotion and disease prevention may encounter internal or external barriers from the health care system. The system may lack financial or political support for health promotion implementation. There may be a lack of time for effective health promotion and disease prevention activities, particularly in competition with the day-to-day demands. Poor communication may exist between the various entities within and outside the health care system. Finally, others within the system may lack interest in health promotion and disease prevention (Rogers et al., 2021).
Part B: Health Screening Follow-Up
Read the scenario, and then answer the questions that follow.
During Deanna’s appointment, a nurse working in the primary care provider’s office is teaching Deanna about lifestyle modifications to lower her high blood pressure level, such as a low-sodium diet and regular exercise. As the nurse is discussing lifestyle changes with Deanna and answering her questions, the office manager calls the nurse out of the room and asks why they are spending longer than the allotted 15 minutes with the client. The nurse explains that Deanna has many questions about the recommended dietary changes. The manager indicates that the client should be dismissed and instruction can be continued at her follow-up appointment in two months.
Answer the following questions based on the case information provided in the chapter thus far.

Factors that Influence Participation in Health Promotion Activities
How individuals and populations define health and health problems, and their perception of health’s importance, influence any attempts to improve their health through health promotion activities. Three factors either support or form barriers to participation in health promotion activities.
A predisposing factor includes any characteristics of the individual or population that affect personal motivation to bring a change in behavior, including their knowledge, beliefs, values, attitudes, and norms. An example of a predisposing factor leading to a positive health outcome would be the belief that smoking is harmful to health.
Reinforcing factors occur in the form of positive or negative feedback, such as rewards or punishments and the influence of a peer, teacher, family, or other person or group perceived as important (). Continued receipt of feedback can motivate repetition of behavior. Using the smoking example, a reinforcing factor leading to a negative health outcome would be peer pressure to smoke.
Enabling factors are social and environmental factors that facilitate or motivate attainment of specific behaviors, such as ease of access, availability, health-related laws, resources, and skills. An example of an enabling factor that leads to a negative health outcome would be the easy availability of cigarettes when other members of the family smoke.  provides additional descriptions and examples of these factors.
Family members attending a graduation ceremony wear masks to prevent the spread of disease during a crowded event, illustrating the reinforcing factors related to following health guidance. (credit: “More Caps & Gowns & Mask” by Phil Roeder/Flickr, CC BY 2.0).
Factors Influencing Participation in Health Promotion
Factors
Description
Examples
Predisposing factors
Intellectual and emotional “givens” that tend to make individuals or populations more or less likely to adopt a healthy or risky behavior or lifestyle or to approve of or accept particular environmental conditions
Knowledge
A person is more likely to avoid using smokeless tobacco if they know it can lead to cancer than if they do not know this.
Attitudes
People who have participated in athletics as youths tend to see regular exercise as a normal part of life.
Beliefs
The belief that if a food’s label says “low fat,” it is healthy to eat.Can also be related to religion or culture: Premarital sex is a sin, so teenagers should not be provided with condoms.
Values
A person who values cleanliness is more likely to follow hand hygiene guidelines than one who does not.
Confidence
Failure to attempt to follow a weight loss regimen simply because a person does not feel they are capable of doing so.
Enabling factors
Internal and external conditions directly related to the issue that help individuals or populations adopt and maintain healthy or unhealthy behaviors or lifestyles, or to embrace or reject particular environmental conditions
Availability of Resources
A person who abuses drugs is more likely to get help if recovery assistance is readily available to them.
Accessibility of Services
If a specialist has a waiting list over a year and is located 10 hours away, a client is less likely to agree to their care.
Community and/or Government Laws/Policies
A person is less likely to drink alcohol if they live in a community that does not sell or serve alcoholic beverages.
Issue-Related Skills
A person who is very organized and manages their time well will be more likely to stick to a prescribed health regimen.
Reinforcing factors
The people and community attitudes that support or make difficult adopting healthy behaviors or fostering healthy environmental conditions
Largely the attitudes of influential people or groups
A child from a family who supported the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic was more likely to wear a mask in public.
Educational interventions can influence some of these factors, while some are not as easily influenced. In the case of reinforcing factors, it may be useful to aim interventions at these influential people and groups to effectively impact an actual target individual or group (The University of Kansas, 2023).
When providing educational interventions, the nurse must also consider the health literacy of individuals. Health literacy involves each person’s ability to find, understand, and use health information and services (HHS, 2021). Health literacy will be discussed in more detail in Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis.

Opportunities for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Across Health Care Settings
The Ottawa Charter first introduced the term health promotion setting, a place or social context where daily activities and various factors interact to influence health and well-being. Health promotion settings are actively used and shaped to address health-related issues rather than used solely for delivering specific services or programs. Typically, settings have physical boundaries, defined roles for people, and an organizational structure (WHO, 2021b, p. 30). Health promotion settings exist in cities, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges, and workplaces (Kokko & Baybutt, 2022). These are described more in .
Health Promotion Settings
Name
Description
Examples
Health Promotion Cities
Global networks of cities that have come together to engage in health promotion and disease prevention
South-East Asia Healthy Cities NetworkThe Partnership for Healthy Cities
Health Promotion Hospitals
First identified in the 1990s as a way to support hospitals that were beginning to put the Ottawa Charter into practice; now range from implementing one health promotion project, to assigning a specific role or department to health promotion, to playing a large part in promoting the health of the community
The Wellness Institute at Seven Oaks General Hospital in Canada
Health Promotion Schools
Established to enhance health through education and promotion for students, school staff, families, and the community
CDC’s Virtual Healthy School that uses the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) model
Health Promotion Universities and Colleges
Guided by the 2015 Okanagan Charter: An International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges, which calls on institutes of higher education to embed health into all aspects of campus culture and to lead health promotion actions and collaboration locally and globally
The University of Alabama at Birmingham Health Promoting University
Health Promotion Workplaces
Provide programs and policies to reduce health risks and improve the quality of life for workers
CDC’s Workplace Health Promotion focused on Hospital Employees’ Health
Urban Health Inequities
Data on urban health inequities, or disparities in health outcomes among and within cities, has been extensively documented worldwide, spanning countries and regions, irrespective of their economic development and health care infrastructure. These disparities reflect the overarching disparities in the social determinants of health including economic conditions, education, the physical and built environment, and the quality and accessibility of health care. To promote health equity, nurses must tailor their health promotion and disease prevention efforts to the specific location and the population being served.
(See Freitas et al., 2020.)
Prisons, the digital environment (including social media), and more recently airports, places of worship, and specific coastal communities in the United Kingdom are other identified health promoting settings (Kokko & Baybutt, 2022). Global initiatives to address the health of those who work and live in prisons, particularly in the United Kingdom, have provided benefits from the development of a “whole-prison approach” to health promotion. This approach involves peer support for both workers and prisoners, behavior modification initiatives, disease prevention and screening, easily accessible information about health services and current health campaigns, and a focus on continuity of care (Woodall & Freeman, 2019). This approach has not been adopted in the United States. However, the CDC (2022) does offer recommendations and guidance for correctional settings, including information on infectious disease, COVID-19 management, traumatic brain injury, and other medical problems and conditions reported by prison inmates.
The WHO (2021a) issued its Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025, which provided guiding principles, strategic objectives, a framework for action, and implementation principles for the strategy and action plan related to using digital technologies to shape the future of global health. This strategy incorporates the use of a variety of technologies to create a continuum of care (WHO, 2021a, p. 8). The WHO (2023b) has also convened a panel of experts to address infodemic management and social listening. An infodemic is an overabundance of information, including misinformation, that surges during a health emergency. The WHO recognizes that during a health emergency, people seek, receive, process, and act on information differently than in other times, making it even more important to use evidence-based strategies to address health issues. Social listening is the process of gathering information about people’s questions and concerns and the circulating narratives and misinformation about health from online and offline data sources. This includes data from social media platforms. The WHO (2023b) hopes to provide an ethical framework and tools that can be used for social listening and infodemic management.
How to Protect Yourself in an Infodemic
Watch this video to learn more about the misinformation that spread during the COVID-19 pandemic, and then answer the following questions:
What are some negative consequences of an infodemic?
Do you see any positive aspects of an infodemic? Explain your answer.
Name three ways you can protect yourself from an infodemic during a pandemic.
Over 400 airports of various sizes prioritized health and safety during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic by becoming accredited or participating in the Airports Council International (ACI, 2023) Airport Health Accreditation (AHA) program. These airports, including a number in the United States, implemented airport industry best practices to ensure an airport-centric approach to health requirements. Moving forward, the program has moved to the Public Health and Safety Readiness (PHSR) accreditation, which considers a wider range of health emergencies that may lead to air travel concerns (ACI, 2023). A variety of research has also been performed investigating the benefits of health promotion in places of worship (Kwon et al., 2017; Tomalin et al., 2019; Woodard et al., 2020) and determined that faith-based organizations and places of worship can play a vital role in health promotion, particularly for Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities.
Finally, a setting for health promotion can be even larger than a city. The United Kingdom House of Commons (2022) has identified, through a 2021 Chief Medical Officer’s report, that English coastal communities have a higher disease burden across physical and mental health conditions as well as lower health outcomes including life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, and disability-free life expectancy. In particular, there are worrying trends in public-health-related outcomes for children and young people. As a result, the Royal College of Physicians and others are encouraging a national strategy to improve the health of these coastal communities.
No consensus exists on a single setting that is best for health promotion. In contrast, it is abundantly clear that there are a variety of settings around which individuals and groups live, grow, work, and age that are appropriate for health promotion and disease prevention activities. Settings can be as small as an office and as large as a country, but collaboration and coordination of all entities involved can lead to improvement of health outcomes.

Chapter Summary
Many factors that influence the health of individuals and communities include both individual- and system-level barriers, described using the social determinants of health (SDOH). The health care delivery system also poses barriers to health promotion and disease prevention. Predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors can be supportive or produce obstacles, and the health care professional must consider these in their efforts to promote health and prevent disease. Various health promotion settings include cities, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges, workplaces, and others. Many successful health promotion and disease prevention programs encourage collaboration and coordination across multiple settings.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Differentiate among assessment tools and data sources (primary and secondary) used to evaluate the health status of populations, communities, and systems.
Use a wide variety of sources and methods to access public health information.
Conduct a community needs assessment considering self-resilient capabilities of a target population to identify and prioritize problems and health concerns.

Community Health Assessment Models, Frameworks, and Tools
CHA models, frameworks, and tools guide community assessment and community health improvement. They provide a systematic, evidence-based process for organizing the assessment team; collecting and analyzing data; and planning, implementing, and evaluating community health improvement strategies. Most assessment and planning frameworks contain common actions. According to the CDC (2023), common elements of assessment and planning frameworks include the following:
Organize and plan
Engage the community
Develop a goal or vision
Conduct community health assessment(s)
Prioritize health issues
Develop a community health improvement plan
Implement and monitor the community health improvement plan
Evaluation process and outcomes
These common actions are evident within the frequently used CHA models, frameworks, and tools described in this chapter. This section reviews the Community Health Assessment toolkit, the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) framework, the Community Health Assessment aNd Group Evaluation (CHANGE) tool, the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Action Model.
Community Health Assessment Toolkit
The American Hospital Association (AHA) developed the Association for Community Health Improvement Community Health Assessment toolkit to assist nonprofit hospitals in meeting Internal Revenue Service regulations for CHAs. The toolkit consists of nine steps for conducting a CHA and developing intervention strategies (AHA, 2017).
The Community Health Assessment Toolkit identifies community engagement as a central component of the CHA process. Community engagement is the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people to identify the health needs of community residents and strategies to address those needs. To engage the community, the nurse must invite community partners to participate. Community partners, also called stakeholders, are all persons, agencies, and organizations that have an investment in the community’s health and in the local public health system (National Association of County and City Health Officials [NACCHO], 2016). This includes community members who benefit from health services and those that provide health services, such as informal or formal leaders from schools, faith-based organizations, businesses, social clubs, health care, transportation, and government. Community members may decide to establish a partnership, a relationship characterized by mutual cooperation and responsibilities among individuals and groups () (NACCHO, 2016). Partnerships may expand into coalition building. A coalition is a group of people and organizations that work to address community needs and solve community problems (PHAB, 2022). Planning Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions further describes partnerships and coalitions.
Community partnerships include community members who benefit from health services and those that provide health services, such as seen in this town meeting at a health center in Maryland. (credit: “Zeta Center for Health and Active Aging Town Meeting” by Maryland GovPics/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Community engagement strengthens the CHA by including diverse perspectives; increasing collaboration and stronger partnerships; sharing a sense of ownership and resources; and improving communication among individuals from the community, community partner organizations, and hospitals. The Community Health Assessment toolkit enhances community engagement by establishing committees that collaborate at each step. Users of the Community Health Assessment toolkit sequentially follow the nine steps described in .

Community Health Needs Assessment
Conducting community health assessment through collaborative partnerships can positively impact the overall process. This video features key team members from two competing health systems and Penn State Hershey, an academic medical center, who participated in a Community Health Needs Assessment of a community in Pennsylvania.
Watch the video, and then respond to the questions below.
Why is it important to conduct a CHNA?
What are the benefits of establishing collaborative partnerships to conduct a CHNA?
What are the goals of a CHNA according to the speakers in the video?
Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships
Public health leaders can use the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) framework for local-level community health improvement planning. The MAPP framework is community-driven and facilitates prioritizing public health issues and identifying resources to address them (NACCHO, 2023). MAPP emphasizes community engagement and collaboration for system-level planning. Originally consisting of six steps, the framework is undergoing redesign (NACCHO, 2020). The redesign includes the foundational principles of equity, inclusion, trusted relationships, community power, strategic collaborations, data-informed action, flexibility, and continuous improvement. The revised MAPP, shown in , provides a streamlined approach to community health assessment and community improvement and directs the nurse and program team through three phases consisting of multiple activities (NACCHO, 2023).

The Revised MAPP Phases
Community Health Assessment aNd Group Evaluation
The CDC developed the Community Health Assessment aNd Group Evaluation (CHANGE) tool for community members who desire to improve their community’s health (CDC, 2010). CHANGE focuses on gathering and organizing data on community assets and potential areas for improvement to prioritize needs for multilevel changes in policies, systems, and the environment. An Action Guide with worksheets and templates assists community members through the eight action steps within the CHANGE tool (see ).
The CHANGE tool divides the community into five sectors: community-at-large, community institution/organization, health care, school, and work site. The community-at-large sector includes the social and built community environments, such as safety, food access, and policies that affect health. The community institution/organization sector includes human services and facility access, such as the YMCA, senior centers, faith-based organizations, childcare, and colleges and universities. The health care sector includes emergency services, clinics, hospitals, and provider offices. The school sector includes primary and secondary learning institutions. The work site sector includes places of employment.
CHANGE Tool Action Step

Plan for activities to meet those objectives.
Evaluate the Community Action Plan annually and upon project completion.
CHANGE Tool Action Steps
PRECEDE-PROCEED Model
The Green and Kreuter PRECEDE-PROCEED model uses a social-ecological, population-level approach to guide health promotion strategies. This model considers the impact of the social determinants of health (SDOH) and the community environment on the target population’s quality of life and needs (Porter, 2016). Members of the target population participate throughout each phase of the model.
PRECEDE stands for Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling Constructs in Educational/Environmental Diagnoses and Evaluations. The PRECEDE process occurs before implementation of an intervention and includes the following four phases:
Define the outcome: Social and situational assessment of what the community wants and needs. Includes data collection and assessment.
Identify the issue: Select the most important issue that can be influenced by an intervention. Includes analysis and prioritization.
Examine factors that influence behavior, lifestyle, and responses to environment: This includes analysis of predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors that influence health promotion. See Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Strategies for further explanation of each factor.
Identify best practices for intervention and organizational issues that could have an impact: Design an action plan.
PROCEED stands for Policy, Regulatory, and Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development. The four phases of PROCEED guide the implementation of the intervention itself. PROCEED is discussed further in Planning Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions as a model used for programming planning, implementation, and evaluation.
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Action Model
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (2023) developed an Action Model for community members to identify community problems and create a plan to improve the community through redevelopment (see ). Redevelopment consists of making changes to an area to impact health outcomes, such as repairing sidewalks and buildings, removing harmful environmental exposures, or building a playground. For example, a community with increased adolescent obesity rates decides to redevelop a park to provide areas for exercise. They add basketball and tennis courts, walking trails, and outdoor exercise equipment to the park.
Community members can work through the four steps of the ATSDR Action Model to identify community problems and create a plan to improve the community through redevelopment. (modification of “The Action Model is built around four steps or questions” by Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/United States Department of Health and Human Services, Public Domain; attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Before working through the Action Model, a team of community members who are interested in the identified issue or are impacted by the issue will play a role in redevelopment plans. A toolkit is available to walk community members through building a team and Action Model steps.

Before working through the Action Model, a team of community members who are interested in the identified issue or are impacted by the issue will play a role in redevelopment plans. A toolkit is available to walk community members through building a team and Action Model steps.

Primary and Secondary Data Sources
A CHA consists of data and information from multiple sources. Required data includes information about the community’s demographics, health status, morbidity and mortality rates, socioeconomic characteristics, quality of life, community resources, behavioral factors, environment, and other social and structural determinants of health (PHAB, 2022). A comprehensive CHA needs a variety of primary and secondary data sources to gather information. In fact, PHAB requires public health departments to use primary and secondary data sources and include both quantitative and qualitative measures. Quantitative data are expressed by amounts in numerical terms. Qualitative data are expressed in word form, cannot be quantified, and describe perspectives of individuals and populations. CHA data and indicators should be valid, reliable, feasible, meaningful, and collected over time.
An assessor collects primary data directly from community members. PHAB considers primary data to be data for which collection is conducted, contracted, or overseen by the health department (PHAB, 2022). Collecting primary data can be time- and resource-intensive.  describes common primary data sources.
Primary Data Source
Description
Participant observation
Purposeful sharing of life in a community, noting details about the people and environment
Includes attendance at local events
Qualitative
Interview key informants
Interview people viewed as local leaders in the community.
The leaders may not have a formal title or position and may include individuals from businesses, organizations, social clubs, religious congregations, civic clubs, or government.
This type of data is qualitative.
Forum or town hall meeting
Community members congregate to discuss a particular issue or proposal that influences all community members.
This may include discussions regarding health policy or infrastructure.
This type of data is qualitative.
Focus group
Small groups of individuals (8–10 per group) are interviewed using mostly open-ended questions.
The interactions between participants may prompt discussion or generate ideas.
This is most often used to reach community members who may not be heard from in other ways.
This type of data is qualitative.
Photovoice
Community members take photos to represent a topic or theme about the community. The photos convey visual messages about community strengths and concerns, adding depth to the CHA.
This is useful when working with groups that may be marginalized or have little power.
This type of data is qualitative.
Survey
Standardized questionnaire via mail, telephone, face-to-face, or electronic
Usually developed through collaboration among multiple community partners
Quantitative and qualitative depending upon survey questions
Windshield survey
Simple observation while driving or walking through a community
Notes common characteristics of people, housing quality, services, and geographic boundaries
Qualitative
Primary Data Sources Used in Community Health Assessment
Secondary data are obtained through an existing report on the community originally collected by another entity or for a purpose other than CHA. Secondary data are usually readily available and may be inexpensive for the assessor. Secondary sources include census data, vital statistics, health indicators, health profiles, and spatial data. Vital statistics are population data about births, deaths, marriages, and divorces in the United States. Health indicators are numerical measures of health outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality, that have been analyzed and are used to compare rates or trends of priority community health outcomes and determinants of health. They are usually attained through secondary data sources. Health indicators provide a snapshot of community health outcomes and allow for benchmarking. A benchmark is a standard or point of reference against which measurements can be compared.

Sources and Methods to Access Public Health Information
A comprehensive CHA contains public health data from various sources displayed in ways to identify trends and patterns. Public health information is also used to compare local data to state and national data, which can be used for benchmarking and to trend data to evaluate progress.
Spatial Data
One method to identify trends and patterns is using spatial data, which identifies the geographic location of phenomena. Spatial data provides an overview of the whole community in map form and facilitates comparing one part of the community to another. This is an important tool to use when conducting a CHA because geographic location can affect access to resources and exposure to health threats. Major differences in health outcomes, especially in mortality rates, have been found even between locations within 5 to 10 miles of each other (Pedigo et al., 2011; Hollar, 2016; Couillard et al., 2021).
Where you live matters!
A person’s geographical location influences their access to healthy foods, education, jobs, safe housing and neighborhoods, facilities that promote health, and health care resources. Individuals living in neighborhoods with greater economic resources have healthier lifestyles. By identifying locations where health disparities exist, even in the same community, nurses can recognize populations at risk for negative health outcomes. Additionally, spatial data helps identify the SDOH within a location that contribute to negative health outcomes. For example, a nurse finds that higher rates of tuberculosis occur in one community area. The nurse uses spatial data to locate the geographical area of tuberculosis diagnoses and assesses potential environmental factors that influence TB’s spread, such as housing and living conditions. The nurse prioritizes interventions by focusing on improving living conditions in the area.
This American Heart Association video explains why a person’s zip code may be more important than their genetic code. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
Consider your community. What areas or locations might you compare using spatial data to clarify whether inequities exist?
How does location relate to social determinants of health and other environmental factors that impact health?
Geographic information systems (GIS) are software and technology that can store, visualize, analyze, and interpret spatial data (CDC, 2019a). The software creates maps electronically using primary or secondary data to determine how location impacts disease and disability. Any data that can be mapped can be used and compared by location. This helps locate areas of communities where high rates of health problems occur.
Nurses and other health care professionals can use GIS maps to identify areas within a community—such as those with higher rates of opioid overdoses, for example—to target them for intervention. Additionally, it is possible to analyze the environment in that location for potential determinants of health that lead to increased opioid use and overdose. GIS tools and examples can be found on the CDC’s website.
Using GIS to Predict Outbreaks
This Queens University video describes how researchers are using GIS to create interactive maps to track information about a range of topics, such as population movement and infection rates of emerging diseases. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How can maps be used in community health assessment to determine health patterns?
How were GIS and other assessment data used to predict the spread of COVID-19?
How can GIS data be used to plan for intervention within a community?
Secondary Data Sources
Public health information sources provide data on local, state, and federal health indicators. During the CHA, the team can use these secondary sources to compare local health data to other municipalities, state, and federal health data for benchmarking. All are quantitative data sources.  describes frequently used secondary data sources and methods to access public health information.

Secondary Data Sources to Enhance a Community Health Assessment
Reduce Drug Overdose Deaths
Drug overdose deaths are one common health indicator measured within a CHA and are considered a national emergency. As such, a leading health indicator of Healthy People 2030 within Drug and Alcohol Use objectives is reducing drug overdose deaths. The target goal for this health indicator is 20.7 drug overdose deaths per 100,000 people, which was the baseline measure in 2018. In 2020, 28.3 drug overdose deaths per 100,000 individuals occurred; in 2021, 32.4 drug overdose deaths per 100,000 individuals occurred.
At this time, the 2020 and 2021 data signify that drug overdose deaths have increased in the United States. This aligns with the public health emergency declaration for the opioid crisis.

Spatial Data
One method to identify trends and patterns is using spatial data, which identifies the geographic location of phenomena. Spatial data provides an overview of the whole community in map form and facilitates comparing one part of the community to another. This is an important tool to use when conducting a CHA because geographic location can affect access to resources and exposure to health threats. Major differences in health outcomes, especially in mortality rates, have been found even between locations within 5 to 10 miles of each other (Pedigo et al., 2011; Hollar, 2016; Couillard et al., 2021).
Where you live matters!
A person’s geographical location influences their access to healthy foods, education, jobs, safe housing and neighborhoods, facilities that promote health, and health care resources. Individuals living in neighborhoods with greater economic resources have healthier lifestyles. By identifying locations where health disparities exist, even in the same community, nurses can recognize populations at risk for negative health outcomes. Additionally, spatial data helps identify the SDOH within a location that contribute to negative health outcomes. For example, a nurse finds that higher rates of tuberculosis occur in one community area. The nurse uses spatial data to locate the geographical area of tuberculosis diagnoses and assesses potential environmental factors that influence TB’s spread, such as housing and living conditions. The nurse prioritizes interventions by focusing on improving living conditions in the area.
This American Heart Association video explains why a person’s zip code may be more important than their genetic code. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
Consider your community. What areas or locations might you compare using spatial data to clarify whether inequities exist?
How does location relate to social determinants of health and other environmental factors that impact health?
Geographic information systems (GIS) are software and technology that can store, visualize, analyze, and interpret spatial data (CDC, 2019a). The software creates maps electronically using primary or secondary data to determine how location impacts disease and disability. Any data that can be mapped can be used and compared by location. This helps locate areas of communities where high rates of health problems occur.
Nurses and other health care professionals can use GIS maps to identify areas within a community—such as those with higher rates of opioid overdoses, for example—to target them for intervention. Additionally, it is possible to analyze the environment in that location for potential determinants of health that lead to increased opioid use and overdose. GIS tools and examples can be found on the CDC’s website.
Using GIS to Predict Outbreaks
This Queens University video describes how researchers are using GIS to create interactive maps to track information about a range of topics, such as population movement and infection rates of emerging diseases. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How can maps be used in community health assessment to determine health patterns?
How were GIS and other assessment data used to predict the spread of COVID-19?
How can GIS data be used to plan for intervention within a community?

Secondary Data Sources
Public health information sources provide data on local, state, and federal health indicators. During the CHA, the team can use these secondary sources to compare local health data to other municipalities, state, and federal health data for benchmarking. All are quantitative data sources.  describes frequently used secondary data sources and methods to access public health information.

Conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment
The first steps of conducting a CHA, no matter the framework, model, or tool chosen as a guide, are planning, engaging the community, and recruiting the assistance of key community partners. After creating the team and determining team roles, the next step is defining the community and the data collection process.
A community may be defined by geography or place of residence, shared characteristics or demographics, or common interests. PHAB (2022) defines a community as a group of people with common characteristics; this can be defined by location, race, ethnicity, age, occupation, interest in particular problems or outcomes, or other common bonds. The definition of the community may change depending upon the context. For a CHA, the community should be defined by people, place or environment, and community systems.  clarifies data that fall under each category.

People, Place, and Community Systems Used to Define Community Within a CHA
Data gathering is required to assist with defining the community. A rich CHA and definition of the community contain both quantitative and qualitative data, and PHAB requires a CHA to show evidence of both (PHAB, 2022). To provide a comprehensive picture of the community, the CHA should include several primary and secondary data collection methods to define the community. Refer to  for potential primary data sources and  for potential secondary data sources. Primary data sources may include qualitative data, quantitative data, or both. Secondary data sources are quantitative in nature.
The community health nurse focuses on data regarding areas of need. This includes mortality, morbidity, and other health outcome data, such as SDOH. A comprehensive review of access to education, healthy nutrition, transportation, healthy spaces, resources for exercise, health care services, economic opportunities, a healthy environment, and employment provides perspective on potential causes of negative health outcomes and areas for improvement.
The community health nurse should not focus only on data regarding areas of need, but on areas of strength and potential resources as well. The values and beliefs of the community, available resources, and current and potential funding are considered. Community values and beliefs are important to ensure community buy-in when programs are implemented to target an identified area of concern. Although statistical health data may indicate poor outcomes in one area, other health-related areas may be of greater concern and importance to community members. Evaluation of the adequacy of community systems should also occur. One method to assess the extent to which community agencies successfully provide support is the seven As (Truglio-Londrigan & Gallager, 2003):
Awareness: Community members are aware that a service is needed and know where to attain that service.
Access: Community members can contact the agency, can navigate the agency’s technology, and have no limitations in getting to the service.
Availability: Service is offered at a time, location, and place that is convenient for community members.
Affordability: Community members are able to pay for the service.
Acceptability: Community members perceive that the service is meeting their needs.
Appropriateness: Community members believe the service is suitable.
Adequacy: Service is provided in sufficient quantity or degree.
Assigned individuals or groups within the CHA team carry out the work of data collection. Most often, the local public health department or health care system provides team leadership. Some CHA teams may decide to hire outside professionals to conduct the work of data collection and subsequent work writing in collaboration with the CHA team.
Most CHAs include surveys mailed to randomly selected community members. The team creates surveys in collaboration with various community partners and organizations that provide care to community members. Most often, these individuals and organizations have information that they need to determine if the care and programs they provide are still needed and effective. For example, a representative from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may be a part of the CHA team and ask that data regarding breastfeeding is collected. This ensures that the data collected is not only useful to the public health department, but to community partners as well.
Key interviews or focus groups add important qualitative information regarding the values and beliefs of the community. Examples of questions that may be asked to determine the values, beliefs, and concerns of community members include the following:
What do you consider to be the major health concerns of the community?
What do you consider to be the least important health issues of the community?
What are some of the current efforts to address health concerns of the community?
What do you consider to be strengths of the community?
What do you consider to be challenges of the community?
What do you consider to be needs of community members that are not being addressed?
In your opinion, why are those needs not being addressed?
It is of note that youth data may be difficult to collect. School-age children complete multiple required assessments per year, which takes away from instruction. Additionally, parents must provide permission for assessment, which is not always granted. Often youth data are derived from either data collected by other agencies or organizations or by surveys completed by school-age youth enrolled in local schools. For example, the Ohio Healthy Youth Environment Survey (OHYES!) is a free survey schools can use to collect data from students in grades 7–12 (Ohio Department of Health, 2023). It includes questions about health, safety, and behavior health factors.
Data collection ends when all planned assessment tasks are conducted and the data represent a comprehensive view of the community. The data are collated into a final written report and presented by topic. Most often, the CHA report contains topic areas such as health care access, adult health behaviors, chronic disease, social conditions, youth health, and demographics. The data are presented in written format, tables, graphs, and images to highlight areas of strength and concern. Examples of current CHA reports can be found on most public health department or health care system websites.
Part A: Conducting a CHA
Read the following scenario, and then answer the questions that follow.
After contacting community members, Tia joined an assessment team with the goal of implementing interventions to combat the opioid crisis. The team chose the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide its assessment and planning for intervention. During the first phase, Social Assessment, data regarding community needs and desires are collected. The team found that community members are concerned about the current opioid crisis and would like to reduce substance abuse and overdose death rates. During the second phase, Epidemiological Assessment, the team gathers data from primary and secondary sources and considers behavioral and environmental factors contributing to the opioid crisis. During the third phase, Educational and Ecological Diagnosis, the team identifies predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors of the opioid crisis.

Chapter Summary
CHA is the first step of the nursing process for populations and communities. It uses a systematic, collaborative approach to gather primary and secondary data to comprehensively describe the community. It uses frameworks, models, and tools to guide community assessment. The process defines people, place, and community systems using a variety of primary and secondary data sources that include quanatitative and qualitative data. Throughout the assessment process, collaboration with the community and multiple partners ensures that community needs for health promotion and disease prevention are met.

To address this issue, a comprehensive community health assessment (CHA) can be conducted to identify the areas and populations most affected by drug overdose deaths. Spatial data can be used to compare different locations within the community to clarify whether inequities exist in access to resources and exposure to health threats. By analyzing spatial data, nurses and other health care professionals can identify areas within the community with higher rates of drug overdose deaths and target them for intervention.

Geographic information systems (GIS) can be utilized to store, visualize, analyze, and interpret spatial data, allowing for the creation of maps that electronically determine how location impacts disease and disability. GIS tools can help identify areas within the community with higher rates of drug overdose deaths and analyze the environmental factors contributing to increased opioid use and overdose. By using GIS, health care professionals can plan and implement targeted interventions to address the opioid crisis within the community.

In addition to spatial data and GIS, secondary data sources such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), Population-Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES), CDC Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER), and other public health information sources can provide quantitative data on local, state, and federal health indicators. These secondary data sources can be used to compare local health data to other municipalities, state, and federal health data for benchmarking and to identify trends in drug overdose deaths.

By utilizing spatial data, GIS, and secondary data sources, a comprehensive CHA can provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to drug overdose deaths within the community and guide the development of targeted interventions to reduce drug overdose deaths and address the opioid crisis.","opioid crisis. o adess his issue, a comprehensie community health assessmet HA) can be conucte to dentify the aes nd poplaion mst affecte y drug vedoe deaths patial data can be se to compare dierent loations witin te ommunity to larif weter ineuities eis in access to resouce and eposur to health trets  analing sti at, ure and oer health care proessionals can identi areas within the community ith hie ate  dru overdose eths and taet them for intervention.eograhi inoratin tems S can e utii to sore, visuie, aalye, and nterpet satial data lloing for the creation of mas that eetronically dtermine h loaton impact isae ad isal.  toos can elp identy areas wtin the community th ighe aes o dg overoe eat and ae th enironmental fators ctriting to iceaed poid ue an oerdose y usin  health care professionals ca ln and eent tarete inerventons t ares  oioi risis itin the community.n adition to spatil data an S, seonda data soces suh as the ehaviora i ator reilane uy  outionee nalsis and ommunity stimates   Wideain lin ata for demiooi esearch W nd other pi heth infomatin ources can provide antitative data on local, tate and federal health ndictors. hese seconda data source an e sed to copare lcal health daa to other niipalites stt and feeral health dat or ecmaring ad to identif trends i g oveose deaths tiiing spaial data  and secoda dat ours a corehensie  can ovde aae insights ino he factors contributing to drug oerdose deaths ithi the community and ide the eeoment o taetedineentin to reduce du verose eath and aress the opiod isi.",16.349324539942558,opioid crisis. this a community health to the and data to the to in access to resources and health and health areas the community of and systems can to and for the of that determine and the community of and the to health to address the the In to data data the Survey and Data and data and health data can be to to and data and to overdose and secondary factors contributing to the and the of to and the,5.835734870317003, environmental factors contributing to ,0.2881844380403458

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Define health literacy.
Assess the health literacy of a population to guide health promotion and disease prevention activities.
Examine one or more health literacy assessment tools.
Examine how people learn and the factors that influence learning and knowledge acquisition.

Health Literacy
Only 12 percent of U.S. adults have the health literacy skills to manage the complex U.S. health care system (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2020). This leads to mismanagement of client conditions, increased risk for disease and disability, reduced health promotion and disease prevention behaviors, and negative client outcomes. One overarching goal of Healthy People 2030 is to “eliminate health disparities, achieve health equity, and attain health literacy to improve the health and well-being of all” (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2021, para 1). Healthy People 2023 defines two types of health literacy, personal and organizational. Personal health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others. Organizational health literacy is the degree to which organizations equitably enable individuals to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.
These definitions emphasize an individual’s ability to understand and use health information to make well-informed decisions. Health literacy also involves acting on the understanding of health information in all situations, such as making decisions regarding voting on health-related policy, choosing a health care provider, or even choosing where to live (Santana et al., 2021). The organizational definition acknowledges that organizations are responsible for addressing health literacy and ensuring equity of health literacy.
Five Things to Know About Health Literacy
Health care is a culture with its own language and systems that are unfamiliar to many clients. This includes clients who speak English, those with limited English proficiency, and those who have difficulty reading and using numbers. Health information and health care services may be challenging to find, understand, and use, yet health literacy is key in understanding and applying health information. This video describes populations at greatest risk for health literacy challenges and strategies nurses, other health care professionals, and organizations can use to improve health literacy. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What populations are at greatest risk for literacy challenges?
What can organizations and health professionals do to improve health literacy?
What are strategies nurses may use to check that clients understand information?

Population Health Literacy Assessment to Guide Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Activities
Including health literacy assessment as a component of the CHA helps the nurse understand the health education needs of individuals and communities. The health literacy level of individuals, aggregates, and community guides health promotion and disease prevention activities. An aggregate is a specific subgroup of a community or population. Individual, aggregate, and community health literacy skill levels impact health-related decisions and behaviors. Three levels of health literacy include functional, interactive, and critical () (Nutbeam & Muscat, 2020). Understanding health literacy levels guides the nurse in choosing appropriate health promotion and disease prevention activities that align with the client’s current health literacy level and enhance health literacy by utilizing activities associated with the next level. Health literacy assessment should be ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of health promotion and disease promotion activities.

Health Literacy Levels Guide Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Activities

Health Literacy Assessment Tools
Including health literacy assessment as a component of the CHA helps the nurse understand the health education needs of individuals and communities. CHA teams can include health literacy assessment questions in CHA surveys, interviews with key community partners, and focus groups. Individual assessment of health literacy of targeted, high-risk populations can occur using a personal health literacy assessment tool. Organization health literacy assessment tools are available to assess community health systems. Including the results of this information in the final CHA report will highlight a community’s educational health literacy needs and changes needed within community health systems to enhance the health literacy of consumers. Health literacy assessment tools are available to assess health literacy skills at the personal and organizational levels.
Personal Health Literacy Assessment Tools
Personal health literacy assessment tools measure an individual’s ability to find, understand, and use health-related information and services and help the nurse determine a client’s health literacy level. The client’s health literacy level will guide interventions, including educational tools the nurse uses to provide health information and to improve health literacy.
Multiple tools are available that measure different aspects of health literacy. For example, The Health Literacy Tool Shed (Boston University, 2023) is an online database that contains information about health literacy assessment tools. Over 200 free and paid tools are available to measure terminology comprehension, application, information seeking and eHealth, and media comprehension of medicine, dentistry, genetic, and general health literacy. Tools are available for adults and youth in a variety of languages and for specific diagnoses such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, HIV, infectious disease, intellectual disability, kidney transplant, mental health, oral health, and vascular surgery.
Organizational Health Literacy Assessment Tools
Organizational health literacy assessment guides health promotion and disease prevention activities at the organizational and systems level. Organizational health literacy assessment tools identify areas of strength and areas for improvement. These findings guide the organization in health literacy improvement efforts at the systems level. Assessment findings should be reported to the organization’s committee that deals with health literacy and key organization administrators. For example, the Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers (HLE2) tool measures organizational policies, institutional practices (resources, staff orientation and development, and expectations), navigation within the organization (signage and staff assistance), culture and language (respect for diversity, language serves, and staff training), and communication (print materials, forms, websites, and patient portals). The HLE2 suggests focusing on percentage scores for each section of the assessment tool as a way to identify strengths and weaknesses, select priority areas, and generate ideas for action (Rudd et al., 2019).
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2020) created the AHRQ Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit to assist organizations in taking steps to simplify communication and confirm client comprehension, improve navigation of the environment and health care system, and support efforts to improve health. The CDC (2019b) provides additional resources to assess organizational health literacy and tools to train staff, develop client materials, meet the needs of consumers with a range of health literacy skills, improve access to health information and services, and communicate clearly during crises.

Learning Process for Knowledge Acquisition
Disease prevention and health promotion begin with education of the individual and communities. Education is the establishment and arrangement of events to facilitate learning and skill development. Learning is the process of gaining knowledge and skills that lead to behavioral changes. Effective evidence-based community education programs are needed to increase health literacy, decrease health disparities, promote disease prevention, and promote health. Learning theories, health promotion models, and educational principles explain behavior and assist nurses in guiding community health strategies and choosing which intervention will be more likely to increase learning. Nurses should consider the identified health problem, population, and context of the planned program when choosing a learning theory or model. Often disease prevention and health promotion programs utilize one or more theories or models.
Selected Learning Theories
To provide effective health education to individuals and communities, nurses must understand the three domains of learning—cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain is related to knowledge and includes thinking, memory, recognition, understanding, and application, moving from simple to complex. An example is the learner stating three signs of diabetes. The affective domain is related to perceptions and feelings, including changes in attitudes and development values. An example is a client with diabetes stating they feel as if they can manage their symptoms. The psychomotor domain is the performance of skills that require neuromuscular coordination. Learning in this domain depends on ability, a sensory image of how to carry out the skill, and practice. An example is self-administration of insulin.
Learning theories frequently used in community health education programs include behaviorism, social cognitive learning theory, constructivism, and adult learning theory. Planning Community Health Education discusses learning theories in more detail.
Factors That Influence Learning and Knowledge Acquisition
Nurses must consider factors that influence learning and knowledge acquisition when planning disease prevention and health promotion community educational programs. Age, culture, language, reading and comprehension skills, technology, and learner characteristics and experiences influence learning and knowledge acquisition, as do educator characteristics, experiences, and preparation. Learner characteristics include health literacy, self-efficacy, and motivation. Educator characteristics and preparation are public speaking, teaching or classroom/group management, choice of learning theory and teaching strategy, and planning.
Educator preparation and planning significantly impact the factors that influence learning and knowledge acquisition. Following the steps in the development of community education programs and choosing effective, evidence-based theories and strategies decrease both learner-related and educator-related barriers to learning. The educational method chosen should be the one that meets the learning needs of the population and makes the most impact.
The steps in in developing a community-based education program are as follows:
Identify population learning need.
Establish goals and objectives.
Select appropriate educational methods.
Select learning theories to use.
Consider educational principles that are most appropriate.
Examine educational issues/barriers.
Design and implement the educational program.
Evaluate the educational process and effects of the program.
Identifying a population’s learning needs occurs with community health assessment; these needs are then prioritized in the analysis phase. Assessment also identifies a population’s age, culture and language, educational level, and potential barriers to learning. Individual learner assessment can be used to clarify those learning needs and identify learner characteristics, including learning style, health literacy, and readiness to learn.
Educational methods should align with the age and developmental level of the target population. Pedagogy, where the teacher holds full responsibility for the teaching-learning process, is appropriate for children. Additionally, younger children require concrete examples, interactive activities, and repetition for knowledge acquisition. In contrast, adults learn best using andragogy, where learners share the responsibility of developing learning goals. This corresponds with the principles of adult learning theory.
When choosing educational methods, nurses should consider the target population's cultural beliefs, language barriers, educational level, health literacy, and motivation. Content and materials should align with cultural beliefs. Multilingual materials (presentation and written) may be needed. Additionally, because more than half the U.S. population ages 16–74 reads below a sixth-grade reading level (Schmidt, 2022), written educational materials should use plain language and be no higher than a fourth- to sixth-grade reading level (CDC, 2022). Content and materials should also align with health literacy levels. Refer to  for examples of teaching strategies for functional, interactive, or critical health literacy levels. Finally, aligning a learner’s motivation with the chosen teaching strategy facilitates learning.
Because individuals process information differently, nurses should consider the target population’s learning styles when choosing educational methods. Visual learners think in pictures or images and learn best through seeing and visualization. Appropriate educational methods for visual learners include taking notes and viewing videos, presentations, and pictures or images. Auditory learners process information and learn best through listening; appropriate educational methods are verbal lecture, discussion, music, podcasts, and reading aloud. Tactile-kinesthetic learners process information and learn best through doing and exploration. Appropriate educational methods are learning by trial and error, hands-on or interactive activities, and return demonstration.
Theory should be a foundation for community program planning and development and is consistent with the current emphasis on using evidence-based interventions in public health (Lhachimi et al., 2016) The chosen theory’s assumptions about a behavior, health problem, target population, or environment should be a good fit, logical, consistent with observations, similar to those used in previous successful programs, and supported by research (National Cancer Institute, 2005).
Finally, the educator considers the learning environment. To stimulate learning and reduce barriers, nurses should create a comfortable, distraction-free environment that encourages interaction. The educator needs experience managing a learning environment and the skills to minimize distractions, present content to enhance learner comprehension, evaluate teaching methods throughout the learning process, modify plans as needed to meet learner needs, and manage technology.

Selected Learning Theories
To provide effective health education to individuals and communities, nurses must understand the three domains of learning—cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain is related to knowledge and includes thinking, memory, recognition, understanding, and application, moving from simple to complex. An example is the learner stating three signs of diabetes. The affective domain is related to perceptions and feelings, including changes in attitudes and development values. An example is a client with diabetes stating they feel as if they can manage their symptoms. The psychomotor domain is the performance of skills that require neuromuscular coordination.

Chapter Summary
Analysis of community health assessment data is the second step of the community nursing process using a team approach to organize and synthesize collected data. The team compares local data to previous assessments and other local community, state, and national data. The team organizes the data to to describe the problem, whom it effects, where it occurs, and when it occurs. The team creates a list of no more than 12 community health problems to consider for intervention. Further analysis of the identifed health problems includes answering why and how the problem is occuring. The team gathers information to help answer those questions and prioritize the problems. Information includes community strengths and resources, at-risk populations, health disparities and inequities, and the consequences of not intervening.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Identify health patterns across populations by comparing data at the local, regional, tribal, and national levels to benchmarks.
Analyze behavioral, environmental, and other factors influencing health.
Synthesize assessment findings to prioritize education/health promotion/disease prevention needs, resources, and capacity.

Analyze Data to Identify Health Patterns and Factors That Influence Health
First, the CHA team completes a statistical analysis of survey data and other quantitative information. Most often, the data are presented in frequencies, percentages, and/or central tendencies. Primary and secondary data are organized by topic or health pattern to assess completeness and determine if data are missing. If data appear to be missing, the team collects additional information. For example, if input from an at-risk population is missing, the team may hold a focus group to gather the missing data.
Morbidity and mortality data collected in the current assessment are presented along with previous assessment, state, and U.S. data, usually in table format. The team may also include other local municipality or county data. If data are available, the specific population at risk is noted. Specific populations at risk may be designated according to age, income level, gender, race/ethnicity, and/or geographical location. These data are used to benchmark state and federal data and evidence-based health standards. CHA teams may use the State Health Assessment/State Health Improvement Plan (refer to ) to benchmark against the state. Healthy People 2030 also contains evidence-based federal standards that can be used for benchmarking.
Next, the team reports on factors influencing health in written or table format. Factors include health care access, health behaviors, and environmental and social conditions such as economic stability, education, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context. The report may also include data from other localities, the state, and the United States for benchmarking purposes. Including the County Health Rankings Model described in Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes ensures SDOH and other factors that influence health outcomes are part of the CHA and analysis.
By this point, the CHA team should have a comprehensive picture of the occurrence and distribution of health patterns and health factors and be able to answer the following questions:
What is the health concern (or health factor), and to what extent is it occurring?
Who is impacted by the health concern (or health factor)? Is one aggregate affected more than others?
Where is the health concern (or health factor) most prevalent?
When, if applicable, is the health concern (or health factor) occurring?

Synthesize Assessment Findings to Prioritize Needs
Synthesis aims to critically analyze each health concern to identify why and how the problem is occurring. This step moves past identifying and organizing the data and links factors influencing health to each health concern. The MAPP framework discussed previously offers tools to assist synthesis (NACCHO, 2023). The MAPP strategic issues identification worksheet guides the time to identify an issue and provides a rationale on why it is an issue and the consequences of not addressing it. The strategic issues relationship diagram illustrates how information from different assessments relates to the identified issue.
Common health needs and themes emerge, and the team creates a problem list of no more than 12 issues based on a synthesis of primary and secondary community assessment data (NACCHO, 2023). This can be managed by merging similar topics into one theme. Each problem should include the aggregate most impacted, community needs or gaps, available community resources, and capacity for change. The problem list is prioritized as part of the next phase of the community nursing process.

Chapter Summary
Most community health programs use education as a strategy for health promotion and disease prevention. Health literacy and other factors that influence learning and knowledge acquisition should be assessed at the community level within the CHA and at the individual and aggregate levels when planning for interventions. Tools are available to assist in assessment of personal and organizational health literacy. Learning theories and health promotion models guide assessment and planning for education and learning. Factors that infludence or hinder learning acquisition should also be considered during assessment of health education needs and when planning for education.

The team then prioritizes the problems based on the severity of the issue, the impact on the community, and the capacity to address it. This prioritization process ensures that the most critical health concerns are addressed first, maximizing the impact of interventions and resources. Once the problems are prioritized, the team can develop targeted strategies and interventions to address each issue effectively. This comprehensive approach to synthesizing assessment findings and prioritizing needs ensures that the CHA team can develop a focused and impactful plan for improving community health outcomes.","resources, and paitre.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Utilize various approaches and assessment findings to identify and prioritize individual, family, community, system, and population health concerns.
Appraise the level of nursing intervention to make the most impact.
Integrate individual, family, community, system, and population experiences and perspectives in designing plans of care.
Develop a nursing community diagnosis and plan of care tailored to community culture.

Prioritize Health Concerns
The CHA team uses the identified problem list created during analysis to prioritize community problems based on these factors:
Extent of the problem (percent of the population affected by the problem and perception of health needs)
Relevance of the problem (degree of risk and economic loss)
Estimated effect of the intervention (impact, improvement of health outcomes, and potential adverse effects)
Health priorities should be those for which intervention would make the most impact on the community as a whole or for a specific at-risk population. Health priorities are those that have the
highest community perception of need,
largest reach,
highest degree of risk if unaddressed,
greatest economic impact,
greatest opportunity for improvement in health outcomes,
opportunity to promote health equity and reduce health disparities, and
least adverse effect on the population.
The team should base priorities on community strengths and available resources to increase the possibility of successful implementation of programs targeting those priorities. Resources include current and potential partnerships and collaborations, human resources or capacity, and funding. Health concerns may also be prioritized because they align with state and federal priorities, allowing for benchmarking and comparison to state and local data. Additionally, monies are usually available to fund programs that align with state or federal priorities.
The method the CHA uses to prioritize health concerns is determined by the CHA model, framework, or tool it chose at the beginning of the process. For example, a CHA team using the MAPP framework will first rank identified problems individually and then use a consensus to choose priorities or strategic issues. MAPP offers several tools to guide this process (NACCHO, 2023). In contrast, a CHA team using the Community Health Assessment toolkit would first identify specific criteria for prioritization and then choose an approach, such as group vote with majority deciding, averaging individual rankings, or using a matrix to weigh and rank criteria according to several factors (baseline data, feasibility, availability of resources, etc.) (AHA, 2017).
PHAB (2022) requires at least two health priorities, but most community care plans or community health improvement plans include at least three priority topics. Choosing health priorities also includes picking at least one health outcome indicator to measure health problem changes and identify the priority population of focus. For example, a team may choose mental health and addiction as a health priority. The priority outcome of this focus should then align with data collected during the CHA. Examples of mental health and addiction topic priority outcomes are “decrease the percentage of the community with depression,” “decrease suicide deaths,” and “decrease drug overdose deaths.”

Develop the Community Nursing Diagnosis
The community nursing diagnosis includes only one identified priority and the aggregate (population) affected, and it provides a rationale. A community nursing diagnosis should be written for each selected priority and include these three parts:
Risk of: Identifies a specific problem or health risk faced by the community
Among: Identifies the specific community aggregate with whom the nurse will be working in relation to the identified problem or risk
Related to: Describes characteristics of the community
The community problem must be observable and measurable at the aggregate level. It considers which aggregate the risk affects most and which intervention will have the biggest impact. The community’s characteristics may contribute to the identified problem and/or be strengths of the community that can be built upon.
Examples of appropriately written community nursing diagnoses are as follows:
Risk of drug overdose among Hardin County adults related to increased opioid usage, presence of fentanyl, lack of available naloxone, ineffective drug abuse prevention programs, and decreased access to drug rehab programs
Risk of infant and child malnutrition among families in Richmond County related to lack of regular developmental screenings, knowledge deficit about infant-related and child-related nutrition, knowledge deficit about available community resources, and lack of access to healthy foods
Risk for cardiovascular disease among Bailey County adults related to sedentary lifestyles, lack of walking trails, lack of safe sidewalks, and lack of affordable exercise facilities
Part B: Conducting a CHA
After selecting the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, Tia’s CHA team completed phases 1–3. During the assessment, the team collected the following data:
GIS data shows one neighborhood with a disproportionate number of drug overdoses. This area also has high poverty and unemployment rates and is located by an entrance/exit on the interstate.
EMS calls for overdoses have tripled since the last CHA.
Drug overdose deaths are higher than the national benchmark (Healthy People 2030).
Provider opioid prescriptions have decreased in the area.
Reported opioid use (attained by any method—legal or illegal) has increased. Heroin usage has increased by 10 percent.
Availability of heroin mixed with fentanyl has increased over the past six months.
Infection rates related to needle use have increased at the local hospital.
Local schools continue to educate on drug abstinence using the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program.
Naloxone training is available from the public health department, but utilization goals have not been reached.
Local EMS staff are volunteers, and the station is not regularly staffed.
A drug rehabilitation center is located within the community but frequently has a waiting list for outpatient appointments and inpatient admission.
Although the PRECEDE-PROCEED model does not require a community nursing diagnosis, the team decided to create one in order to clearly identify the aggregate and characteristics of the community.
The team has started planning for program implementation and wants to begin by promoting and enhancing available community resources, such as education within the schools, community naloxone training, education for providers related to opioid prescriptions, and drug rehabilitation. According to the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, phase 4, Administrative and Policy Diagnosis, the team focuses on administrative and organizational concerns that should be addressed prior to program implementation.
Answer the following questions based on the case information provided in the chapter thus far.

Develop the Community Health Improvement Plan
The CHA team uses the identified priorities and community nursing diagnoses to develop the community health improvement plan (CHIP), the care plan for the entire community. PHAB (2022) defines the CHIP as a long-term systematic plan to address issues identified in the CHA that describes how the health department and community will work together to improve population health. Frequently, the public health department holds a leadership role, collaborating with various diverse community organizations to create the CHIP. The members of the CHA team are also usually involved in the CHIP process. As stated previously, the team members are individuals who either work or live within the community, ensuring the CHIP represents the community culture and values. The plan outlines goals and strategies community organizations, coalitions, and members will use to address priority health problems.
The team considers potential interventions for each identified priority. First, the team discusses existing community programs that may meet the community health need. The team performs a gap analysis to determine where the community should expand its efforts to meet community health needs. A gap analysis identifies and addresses the disparity between what is desired and real-world conditions (Davis-Ajami et al., 2014). For example, access to primary health care is a desired community health outcome for all. In reality, all people do not have access to a primary health care provider. A gap analysis identifies the disparity and potential solutions to reduce it. The team brainstorms strategies to enhance current programming and identify potential new interventions to fill the gaps noted to promote health and prevent disease. The team searches for new interventions that meet community needs and are innovative, evidence-based, most impactful, and sustainable. The team should also consider new partnerships to assist with planning or implementation. Finally, the team may complete a SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that may influence health outcomes or may promote or hinder possible interventions. The Minnesota Department of Health online offers more information on completing a SWOT analysis. Overall, the team should select the best intervention after considering the various factors discussed.
The CHIP is designed to immediately follow the CHA and is updated with the CHA. So if the CHA process occurs every three years, the CHIP should be written as a three-year plan. CHIP interventions must align with chosen priorities and include measures for evaluation related to the rationale identified within the corresponding community nursing diagnosis. Current community resources and strengths are considered and integrated into interventions. The CHIP development also considers currently available and potential resources (such as grants) and partnerships. Community interventions are chosen when they are impactful, have the largest reach, are feasible, are innovative, are evidence-based, and can be completed within the CHIP time frame.
CHIP development continues by detailing goals and objectives, action steps, timetables, priority target populations, indicators to measure strategy impact, and accountability. Objectives should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound). Action steps are specific and are listed by year of implementation. The time to complete each action step, target population, health indicator to measure the strategy, and responsible individual or organization is determined. Other details of the interventions are further detailed by the responsible individual or organization during program planning. See Planning Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions for more information on writing SMART objectives.
The CHA and CHIP provide community organizations and health care systems with a common plan for addressing community health issues. The community is a partner in planning for health promotion and disease prevention efforts with community perspectives and community engagement at the center of the process. A comprehensive CHA provides evidence for community health priorities and social determinants of health impacting community health outcomes. The CHIP utilizes established community resources to combat identified priorities and reduce health disparities caused by determinants of health.
Chapter Summary
The third step of the community nursing process is planning. At the beginning of this step, the team prioritizes identified health needs using methods described in the chosen CHA and community health improvement framework, model, or tool and determined by the team. The chosen health priorities are ones in which intervention would make the most impact, utlize community resources, and meet the community’s needs. The community nursing diagnosis provides an explanation of the health need, aggregate, and factors that influence the health need. The CHIP is the nursing care plan for the community. It is developed in collaboration with community members and organizations to be used as a guide for community health intervention and programming.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Apply theoretical framework(s)/models to plan health promotion, disease prevention interventions, and illness management.
Combine knowledge of health determinants with data to plan health promotion and disease prevention interventions for communities and populations.
Assess learning needs across the continuum of care for self-care for health promotion, illness prevention, and illness management.
Examine different approaches to health promotion and disease prevention.

Theoretical Frameworks and Models Used in Program Planning
In collaboration with the program planning team (those individuals and community partners who will provide resources, will implement or evaluate program activities, and will be impacted by the program), the nurse selects a theoretical framework or model to guide program planning. Theoretical frameworks and models provide a systematic method to develop, implement, and evaluate programs for health promotion, disease prevention, and illness management. Community health assessment (CHA) models, frameworks, and tools discussed in Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis include steps for planning programs. These models include comprehensive assessment guidance but do not include specific details to guide program planning. The Healthy Places by Design’s Community Action Model, PRECEDE-PROCEED model, PATCH Model, and Intervention Mapping, described next, provide detailed guidance for program planning. A logic model is a tool used to visually represent a program.
Healthy Places by Design’s Community Action Model
The Healthy Places by Design Community Action Model describes six essential practices for sustained change within communities and outlines an intentional Partner, Prepare, and Progress, or “3P,” Action Cycle. The program planning team considers community context and the six essential practices during all stages of the Community Action Model to enhance the sustainability of actions that promote community health. These include the following:
Health equity focus
Facilitative leadership
Culture of learning
Strategic communication
Sustainable thinking
Community engagement
The 3P Action Cycle includes Partner, Prepare, and Progress stages.  describes tasks at each stage of the 3P Action Cycle and incorporates the six essential practices.
As part of the Healthy Places by Design’s Community Action Model, the program planning team progresses through the 3P (Partner, Prepare, and Progress) Action Cycle to develop and implement community health programs.

Using the Community Action Model to Improve Infrastructure and Promote Physical Activity
The Tulane University Prevention Research Center established the KidsWalk Coalition to improve walking and bicycling infrastructure. The community program was developed, implemented, and evaluated using the Community Action Model. The team used the 3Ps (Partner, Prepare, Progress) throughout the program.
Read the case study Communities in Action: New Orleans, LA, and then respond to the following questions:
How did the KidsWalk Coalition engage the community and strengthen multidisciplinary coalitions?
What policy and infrastructure progress did the KidsWalk Coalition make?
PRECEDE PROCEED Model
The Green and Kreuter PRECEDE PROCEED model considers social determinants of health and the community environment when planning programs for health promotion (Porter, 2016). PRECEDE stands for Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling Constructs in Educational/Environmental Diagnoses, and Evaluation. The four PRECEDE phases are discussed further in Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis. PROCEED stands for Policy, Regulatory, and Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development. PROCEED follows the community assessment and identification of health issues, utilizing that information to guide program planning, implementation, and evaluation, and includes the following four phases:
Implementation: Design and implement the intervention.
Process Evaluation: Evaluate the implementation procedure. Is what was planned actually being done?
Impact Evaluation: Evaluate whether the intervention has the desired impact on the target population.
Outcome Evaluation: Evaluate whether the intervention has produced the desired impact on the problem identified in the PRECEDE phases.
The PROCEED model directs the user to choose an additional tool, such as the PATCH Model, when designing interventions. The program team should select evidence-based interventions most likely to achieve program outcomes (Porter, 2016). Implementation and Evaluation Considerations further describes process, impact, and outcome evaluation.
Planned Approach to Community Health Model
The Planned Approach to Community Health (PATCH) model builds on the PRECEDE model to provide a practical approach to community program planning (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2001). PATCH includes a detailed guide and worksheets to use at each phase; these resources are especially helpful for communities that have little experience with assessment and program planning. PATCH describes five critical elements of community health promotion programming:
Participation of community members
Use of data to guide program development
Development of a comprehensive health promotion strategy
Evaluation to provide timely feedback and for program improvement
Increase in community capacity for health promotion (HHS, 2001)
Capacity can be increased through relationships within the community, state health departments, universities, and other regional and national levels of organizations that can provide data, resources, and consultation. Capacity refers to the resources and relationships required to implement the program (Public Health Accreditation Board [PHAB], 2022). This chapter describes methods to develop these relationships.
PATCH can be used to plan, conduct, and evaluate health promotion and disease prevention programs and includes the following five phases:
Mobilizing the community
Collecting and organizing data
Choosing health priorities
Developing a comprehensive intervention plan
Evaluating PATCH
The first three phases relate to the CHA and community health improvement plan (CHIP) processes described in Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis. The last two phases include development, implementation, and evaluation of community intervention for health promotion. When developing a comprehensive intervention plan, the team considers contributing factors and community-based programs currently being used elsewhere. This includes surveying other agencies and organizations and searching the literature and internet resources regarding current programs related to the identified community problem. PATCH recommends working with systems, such as schools, work sites, and hospitals, starting simple and combining educational, policy, and environmental strategies to enhance the program and make an impact in several ways.
Intervention Mapping
The Intervention Mapping (IM) framework provides a systematic approach to plan community health interventions. The initial steps of IM are based on the PRECEDE model (Fernandez et al., 2019).  describes the six steps of IM and provides examples of tasks that Jamie, the nurse described in the chapter introduction, completed at each step with the program planning team in developing the Kenton Hardin County Family Bike Program (KHCFBP). Logic models, discussed in the next section, are typically used in IM.
IM Step
Tasks to Complete
Example of Tasks Completed by the KHCFPB Program Planning Team
Step 1: Logic Model of the Problem
Establish a team consisting of the target population, individuals and groups impacted by the program outcome, and planning and implementation team.
Conduct a CHA.
Perform analysis of health, quality of life, behaviors, and environmental conditions that influence health problems.
Create a logic model illustrating the problem.
Determine program goals. Goals are discussed in detail in Section 18.3.
Reviewed CHA, which showed that 70 percent of county adults were overweight or obese as defined by BMI, only 29 percent  of adults met national physical activity recommendations, 15 percent of county youth were obese, and only 29 percent of youth met national physical activity recommendations.
The established team included staff from the county health department (director of nursing (DON), fiscal officer), a nurse educator, a YMCA staff member, the county WIC director, and two local bike experts. The team also collaborated with an established county transportation committee that had been looking to add bike paths in the community.
Determined program goal—to increase physical activity of program participants through biking and to increase bike safety.
Step 2: Logic Model of Change
Identify determinants of the identified health problem by searching the literature, choosing theories, and conducting research, if needed.
Select determinants to target during the program.
Determine expected outcomes and objectives. Objectives are discussed in detail in Section 18.3.
Create a logic model of change.
Reviewed literature to locate evidence-based biking programs.
Identified determinants of biking: bike safety, biking skill, bike maintenance, and access to equipment. Also added nutrition to support physical activity.
Determined outcomes and objectives. Section 18.3,  lists the objectives of the KHCFBP.
Step 3: Program Design
Choose theory and evidence-based change methods.
Select or design program delivery methods.
Investigated several physical activity programs targeting youth and adults. Finding no biking program targeting youth and adults, the team designed the program based on five evidence-based programs.
Created logic model of the program.
Step 4: Program Production
Draft messages, materials, and protocols.
Pretest, refine, and produce materials.
Created participant workbooks and facilitator guides with input from the nurse educator, DON, bike experts, and WIC director.
Added the county health department public relations staff to create advertisements.
Met with the team to review and refine the plan for implementation.
Step 5: Program Implementation Plan
Identify persons who are responsible for the delivery of the program.
State outcomes and performance objectives.
Implement the program.
Identified responsible persons. Bike experts delivered curriculum; volunteers assisted with biking skills and maintenance; DON and nurse educator managed logistics (surveys, forms, snacks, and equipment/time management).
Recruited volunteers from a local university to assist with program delivery.
Program was implemented.
Step 6: Evaluation Plan
Develop evaluation indicators, measures, and questions.
Complete evaluation.
Used the CDC Framework for Program Evaluation in Public Health.
Created evaluations with input from the nurse educator, DON, bike experts, and WIC director.
Evaluated participant biking knowledge, helmet use, and amount of time riding prior to, immediately following, and six months after the program.
Conducted both process and outcome evaluations.
IM Steps and Associated Tasks
Logic Models
Logic models are tools to visually present the relationships among resources that are used to implement a program, the activities planned, and the program’s intended results (W. K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004). The logic model describes the sequence of events to connect the program’s need with the desired results and shows how human and financial resources contribute to the program. The Logic Model Development Guide provides a step-by-step method to create logic models. Common components of logic models include the following:
Resources: human, financial, organizational, and community needed to operate the program
Activities: processes, tools, events, technology, and actions for implementation
Outputs: direct products of program activities, such as the number of participants
Outcomes: specific changes in participant behavior, knowledge, or skill, usually designated by short-term and long-term
Impact: fundamental change as a result of the program, usually within 7–10 years

Healthy Places by Design’s Community Action Model
The Healthy Places by Design Community Action Model describes six essential practices for sustained change within communities and outlines an intentional Partner, Prepare, and Progress, or “3P,” Action Cycle. The program planning team considers community context and the six essential practices during all stages of the Community Action Model to enhance the sustainability of actions that promote community health. These include the following:
Health equity focus
Facilitative leadership
Culture of learning
Strategic communication
Sustainable thinking
Community engagement
The 3P Action Cycle includes Partner, Prepare, and Progress stages.  describes tasks at each stage of the 3P Action Cycle and incorporates the six essential practices.
As part of the Healthy Places by Design’s Community Action Model, the program planning team progresses through the 3P (Partner, Prepare, and Progress) Action Cycle to develop and implement community health programs.

Using the Community Action Model to Improve Infrastructure and Promote Physical Activity
The Tulane University Prevention Research Center established the KidsWalk Coalition to improve walking and bicycling infrastructure. The community program was developed, implemented, and evaluated using the Community Action Model. The team used the 3Ps (Partner, Prepare, Progress) throughout the program.
Read the case study Communities in Action: New Orleans, LA, and then respond to the following questions:
How did the KidsWalk Coalition engage the community and strengthen multidisciplinary coalitions?
What policy and infrastructure progress did the KidsWalk Coalition make?

PRECEDE PROCEED Model
The Green and Kreuter PRECEDE PROCEED model considers social determinants of health and the community environment when planning programs for health promotion (Porter, 2016). PRECEDE stands for Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling Constructs in Educational/Environmental Diagnoses, and Evaluation. The four PRECEDE phases are discussed further in Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis. PROCEED stands for Policy, Regulatory, and Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development. PROCEED follows the community assessment and identification of health issues, utilizing that information to guide program planning, implementation, and evaluation, and includes the following four phases:
Implementation: Design and implement the intervention.
Process Evaluation: Evaluate the implementation procedure. Is what was planned actually being done?
Impact Evaluation: Evaluate whether the intervention has the desired impact on the target population.
Outcome Evaluation: Evaluate whether the intervention has produced the desired impact on the problem identified in the PRECEDE phases.
The PROCEED model directs the user to choose an additional tool, such as the PATCH Model, when designing interventions. The program team should select evidence-based interventions most likely to achieve program outcomes (Porter, 2016). Implementation and Evaluation Considerations further describes process, impact, and outcome evaluation.

Planned Approach to Community Health Model
The Planned Approach to Community Health (PATCH) model builds on the PRECEDE model to provide a practical approach to community program planning (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2001). PATCH includes a detailed guide and worksheets to use at each phase; these resources are especially helpful for communities that have little experience with assessment and program planning. PATCH describes five critical elements of community health promotion programming:
Participation of community members
Use of data to guide program development
Development of a comprehensive health promotion strategy
Evaluation to provide timely feedback and for program improvement
Increase in community capacity for health promotion (HHS, 2001)
Capacity can be increased through relationships within the community, state health departments, universities, and other regional and national levels of organizations that can provide data, resources, and consultation. Capacity refers to the resources and relationships required to implement the program (Public Health Accreditation Board [PHAB], 2022). This chapter describes methods to develop these relationships.
PATCH can be used to plan, conduct, and evaluate health promotion and disease prevention programs and includes the following five phases:
Mobilizing the community
Collecting and organizing data
Choosing health priorities
Developing a comprehensive intervention plan
Evaluating PATCH
The first three phases relate to the CHA and community health improvement plan (CHIP) processes described in Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis. The last two phases include development, implementation, and evaluation of community intervention for health promotion. When developing a comprehensive intervention plan, the team considers contributing factors and community-based programs currently being used elsewhere. This includes surveying other agencies and organizations and searching the literature and internet resources regarding current programs related to the identified community problem. PATCH recommends working with systems, such as schools, work sites, and hospitals, starting simple and combining educational, policy, and environmental strategies to enhance the program and make an impact in several ways.

Use Health Determinants and Data to Plan Programs
Community assessment and health determinant data are the basis of effective programs. The first step of program planning, regardless of the framework or model selected, is to review community assessment data related to the identified problem that the program is targeting. This provides a rationale for implementing the program and establishes baseline data for measuring the health problem and evaluating the program.
The nurse also gathers data on determinants of health that contribute to the specific health problem. Determinants of health are combined factors that affect the health of individuals and communities, including individual characteristics and environmental conditions where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age (CDC, 2019; HHS, n.d.). As discussed throughout this text, those environmental conditions are called social determinants of health (SDOH). Individual determinants include age, sex, genetics, and behaviors, such as physical activity, nutrition, and substance use. SDOH include economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context (HHS, n.d.). Access to safe housing and transportation, employment opportunities, food security, income and socioeconomic status, level of education, air and water quality, and health literacy are all examples of SDOH. See Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes for more information.
Social Determinants of Health Animation
This animation describes the influence that SDOH have on health. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
How do social determinants of health impact health outcomes?
What are some community interventions the nurse could implement that would influence each determinant of health described in the video?
The nurse should incorporate health determinants into program planning for several reasons. First, SDOH account for 50 to 80 percent of health outcomes (Whitman et al., 2022; Zhang & Fornili, 2023). Health outcomes are strongly predicted by social and economic factors, followed by health behaviors, clinical care, and the physical environment (Hood et al., 2016). Poor social and economic conditions influence access to health care and an individual’s ability to make healthy choices. For example, healthy food may be unaffordable or unavailable within the community. Additionally, individuals living in impoverished neighborhoods are more likely to experience an unsafe environment, low educational attainment, discrimination, and racism, all of which are associated with chronic stress. The constant release of stress hormones damages body systems and increases the risk of health problems. Second, federal health care programs and organizations have made addressing the SDOH a priority (De Lew & Sommers, 2022). The US Department of Health and Human Services strategy to address the SDOH aims to improve
data by increasing the collection of SDOH data and increasing data sharing among systems;
connections between the health care systems, social services, and communities; and
collaborations and partnerships among government organizations that impact health.
Finally, the nurse and program planning team direct program interventions toward reducing risk of disease. Because SDOH play a significant role in the development of disease, interventions should be directed at those SDOH impacting the community (). Targeting several aspects of determinants of health enhances the likelihood that the program will achieve goals to reduce risk factors, promote health, and prevent illness.
In the KHCFBP example, the public health nurse, Jamie, and the bike program planning team identified determinants of physical activity via biking. Individual determinants of bike riding included motivation and confidence, knowledge of bike safety, and experience with biking and biking skill. Social determinants of bike riding included the ability to purchase bike equipment, the safety of sidewalks and streets, and social support (Hunsicker, 2020). In this instance, program planners decided to target all determinants except sidewalk and street infrastructure because the likelihood of influencing infrastructure changes was low during this program.
Determinants of physical activity include factors in the natural, built, and social environments such as weather, urban design, green space, and culture as well as individual determinants like motivation, beliefs, age, and skills.

Assess Learning Needs Across the Continuum of Care
Effective and relevant community health programs aim to meet the community’s needs by filling the gap between program participants’ knowledge and what is known about a health problem. To understand learning needs, the nurse must assess the target population before the development of program activities. Learning assessments provide perspective regarding the community’s educational needs and guide the choice of program activities to meet them. Therefore, assessment of learning needs and education is an essential component of community health programs.
Using Health Education to Reduce Opioid Overdoses
The Naloxone Education Empowerment Distribution (NEED) program was a successful program that has since been completed. It provided education to first responders, local pharmacies, and interested community members. The NEED program trained, certified, and provided community members with education and skills to successfully administer naloxone to prevent opioid overdose. Although it is not currently active, this evidence-based program can be revisited or used as an intervention to reduce opioid overdose deaths in the future.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What learning needs do you think were identified before the implementation of the NEED program?
How do you think the assessment of learning needs led to the development of the program?
The nurse can use several methods to assess learning needs. The CHA provides an overview of community learning needs. A comprehensive CHA includes community perspectives via survey collection, focus groups or interviews, and statistical data on health outcomes. Analysis of this data gives the nurse a picture of the community’s learning needs. The nurse also assesses the target population’s health literacy at both the community and participant level before program implementation, allowing the nurse to direct activities at the level of participant health literacy. Another method to assess the target population’s learning needs is to include them in the program planning process. Members of the target population can provide their perspective, indicate what information is important to them, and clarify knowledge, skill, or attitude deficits. Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis discusses CHA and health literacy in more detail.

Approaches to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
The nurse and program planning team consider health promotion and disease prevention theories during program development because these theories help explain health behavior and factors contributing to health problems. These theories direct the program planning team to choose interventions that support behavior change. The Health Belief Model (HBM), Transtheoretical Model, and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) are common health promotion and disease prevention approaches used during program planning and implementation. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Strategies provides a detailed overview of each theory. This chapter applies these theories to community nursing practice.
Application of the Health Belief Model
The nurse and program planning team use the Health Belief Model (HBM) to design health promotion and disease prevention strategies. The HBM states that an individual is ready for health change if they
believe they are susceptible to the health problem,
believe the health problem has serious consequences,
believe taking action will reduce their risk of the health problem,
believe the benefits of change outweigh the costs,
are exposed to factors that prompt change, and
are confident in their ability to make a change.
The nurse and program planning team apply the HBM by first assessing the perceptions of the target population. This enables the team to develop activities that align with the population’s needs. For example, if an individual or group does not believe they are susceptible to the health problem, the program would provide education on risks of the health problem. If an individual or group lacks confidence in their ability to make a change, the program would provide training to increase skill and confidence. For example, Jamie and the KHCFBP planning team aimed to increase biking confidence and skill of participants. They developed education on bike maintenance and safety and activities to practice biking skills in order to meet that aim.
Application of the HBM in Community Programs
Community health nurses used the HBM to plan and evaluate community health programs. The M-PACT, Men’s Prostate Awareness Church Training, was a partnership between the local faith community, community members, and the Maryland School of Health. The project goal was to increase informed decision-making for prostate cancer screening among African American men who attend church.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What were the needs and concerns of the African American men that participated in the program?
What specific activities did the M-PACT program use to meet participants’ needs?
How did each activity correspond to the HBM?
Application of the Transtheoretical Model
The nurse and program planning team use the Transtheoretical Model to influence the change process. The Transtheoretical Model states that individuals move through the following five stages when making health behavior changes:
Precontemplation—no intention to make a change within the next six months
Contemplation—intends to act within the next six months
Preparation—intends to act within the next 30 days and has taken steps to plan for change
Action—changes behavior for less than six months
Maintenance—changes behavior for more than six months
The first step in applying the Transtheoretical Model is determining where participants fall within the five stages. The nurse and program planning team then develop activities that align with the stage of change. For example, if the program targets tobacco users in the precontemplation stage, activities would include personalized messages and education regarding the risks of tobacco use. If the program targets tobacco users in the preparation stage, activities would include assistance with setting attainable goals and education on resources to quit.
Applying the Transtheoretical Model
Community health providers use the Transtheoretical Model to determine individual readiness for change and interventions to match readiness for change. Most often this model has been used to assist individuals in quitting unhealthy behaviors, such as tobacco, alcohol, or other drug use, or to start healthy behaviors, such as exercise. The video applies the Transtheoretical Model to treatment of youth who use alcohol or other drugs (AOD).
Watch the video, review the Treatment Matching Tip Sheet, and then respond to the following questions:
What program activities align with individuals who have AOD problems in the preparation stage?
How is motivational interviewing used in the contemplation stage?
Application of Social Cognitive Theory
The nurse and program planning committee using Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) recognize that the social environment influences health behaviors. SCT concepts include the following:
Reciprocal determinism—interaction among the individual, behavior, and environment
Behavioral capacity—knowledge and skill of the individual to perform a health behavior
Expectations—anticipated outcomes of a behavior
Self-efficacy—confidence in changing behavior and overcoming barriers to behavior
Observational learning/modeling—watching another’s behavior and outcomes leading to behavioral change
Reinforcements—response to a behavior that increases or decreases the likelihood of that behavior
The first step in applying SCT involves assessing individual or group knowledge, skills, expectations, and confidence and the social environmental factors influencing the health problem. The program planning team plans activities to enhance participants’ likelihood of adopting a new health behavior based on the SCT concepts. For example, a nutrition education program may model creating a healthy shopping list based on a budget, enhance participant confidence by having them participate in cooking classes, and reinforce healthy choices through verbal praise.
Application of SCT to Reduce Risk of Obesity
Community health providers recognize that health behaviors are influenced by the social environment. Los Angeles Universal Preschool uses SCT to teach healthy habits with the aim of reducing childhood obesity in low-income minority preschool populations.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What determinants of obesity did the preschool teacher influence through purposeful intervention?
What interventions highlight the concepts of SCT?

Application of the Health Belief Model
The nurse and program planning team use the Health Belief Model (HBM) to design health promotion and disease prevention strategies. The HBM states that an individual is ready for health change if they
believe they are susceptible to the health problem,
believe the health problem has serious consequences,
believe taking action will reduce their risk of the health problem,
believe the benefits of change outweigh the costs,
are exposed to factors that prompt change, and
are confident in their ability to make a change.
The nurse and program planning team apply the HBM by first assessing the perceptions of the target population. This enables the team to develop activities that align with the population’s needs. For example, if an individual or group does not believe they are susceptible to the health problem, the program would provide education on risks of the health problem. If an individual or group lacks confidence in their ability to make a change, the program would provide training to increase skill and confidence. For example, Jamie and the KHCFBP planning team aimed to increase biking confidence and skill of participants. They developed education on bike maintenance and safety and activities to practice biking skills in order to meet that aim.

What program activities align with individuals who have AOD problems in the preparation stage?
How is motivational interviewing used in the contemplation stage?

Application of Social Cognitive Theory
The nurse and program planning committee using Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) recognize that the social environment influences health behaviors. SCT concepts include the following:
Reciprocal determinism—interaction among the individual, behavior, and environment
Behavioral capacity—knowledge and skill of the individual to perform a health behavior
Expectations—anticipated outcomes of a behavior
Self-efficacy—confidence in changing behavior and overcoming barriers to behavior
Observational learning/modeling—watching another’s behavior and outcomes leading to behavioral change
Reinforcements—response to a behavior that increases or decreases the likelihood of that behavior
The first step in applying SCT involves assessing individual or group knowledge, skills, expectations, and confidence and the social environmental factors influencing the health problem. The program planning team plans activities to enhance participants’ likelihood of adopting a new health behavior based on the SCT concepts. For example, a nutrition education program may model creating a healthy shopping list based on a budget, enhance participant confidence by having them participate in cooking classes, and reinforce healthy choices through verbal praise.

Chapter Summary
Theories and models of health promotion, disease prevention, and behavior change are used in the development of community health programs. Common theories include the Community Action Model, PRECEDE PROCEED model, PATCH Model, and Intervention Mapping. Logic models are created as a visual representation of a community program. Social determinants of health and population learning needs are also considered. Health promotion and disease prevention approaches, such as the HBM, Transtheoretical Model, and SCT, are applied to motivate and promote program participant behavior change.

SCT concepts include the following: Reciprocal determinism—interaction among the individual, behavior, and environment Behavioral capacity—knowledge and skill of the individual to perform a health behavior Expectations—anticipated outcomes of a behavior Self-efficacy—confidence in changing behavior and overcoming barriers to behavior Observational learning/modeling—watching another’s behavior and outcomes leading to behavioral change Reinforcements—response to a behavior that increases or decreases the likelihood of that behavior The first step in applying SCT involves assessing individual or group knowledge, skills, expectations, and confidence and the social environmental factors influencing the health problem. The program planning team plans activities to enhance participants’ likelihood of adopting a new health behavior based on the SCT concepts. For example, a nutrition education program may model creating a healthy shopping list based on a budget, enhance participant confidence by having them participate in cooking classes, and reinforce healthy choices through verbal praise. Application of SCT to Reduce Risk of Obesity Community health providers recognize that health behaviors are influenced by the social environment. Los Angeles Universal Preschool uses SCT to teach healthy habits with the aim of reducing childhood obesity in low-income minority preschool populations. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions: What determinants of obesity did the preschool teacher influence through purposeful intervention? What interventions highlight the concepts of SCT? Chapter Summary Theories and models of health promotion, disease prevention, and behavior change are used in the development of community health programs. Common theories include the Community Action Model, PRECEDE PROCEED model, PATCH Model, and Intervention Mapping. Logic models are created as a visual representation of a community program. Social determinants of health and population learning needs are also considered. Health promotion and disease prevention approaches, such as the HBM, Transtheoretical Model, and SCT, are applied to motivate and promote program participant behavior change.","health behavior. For example, if the program targets individuals with low self-efficacy, the program would include activities to increase confidence in changing behavior and overcoming barriers. If the program targets individuals with low behavioral capacity, the program would include activities to increase knowledge and skill. Applying SCT in Community Programs Community health nurses use SCT to plan and evaluate community health programs. The Healthy Families program was a home visitation program for first-time mothers. The program aimed to improve maternal and child health outcomes. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions: What social environmental factors influenced the health problem addressed by the Healthy Families program? What program activities were used to enhance participants’ likelihood of adopting a new health behavior? How did each activity correspond to SCT concepts? These health promotion and disease prevention theories provide a framework for the nurse and program planning team to develop, implement, and evaluate community health programs. The nurse and program planning team use these theories to guide program development, select interventions, and evaluate program outcomes. The nurse and program planning team also use these theories to understand the target population’s readiness for change and to develop activities that align with the stage of change. These theories are used to assess the target population’s knowledge, skills, expectations, and confidence and the social environmental factors influencing the health problem. The nurse and program planning team then plan activities to enhance participants’ likelihood of adopting a new health behavior. These theories are applied to community nursing practice to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities.","health behavior.

Community Partnerships and Coalitions
Community engagement is an essential component of program planning. Community engagement is the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people to identify the health needs of community residents and strategies to address them. Any person, agency, or organization that is invested in the community’s health and in the local public health system or is impacted by the outcomes of community health programs should be considered a potential partner. The nurse develops a list of potential partners during the first stages of program planning.  lists potential community partners to consider when planning community health programs (World Health Organization [WHO] & UNICEF, 2022; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], 2012).

Potential Partners for Community Health Programs
A partnership is a relationship characterized by mutual cooperation and shared responsibilities among individuals and groups with a common focus that combine resources to implement joint activities (PHAB, 2022). For example, the local public health department, WIC, the local health system, and the YMCA combine efforts to hold a mom-baby fair (). The public health department provides car seat education and new car seats. WIC provides nutrition education and resources for healthy foods. The local health system provides education on immunizations and safe sleep. The YMCA offers education on mom-baby exercise classes. Each organization also contributes baby items for raffle. 
A community health nurse partners with local organizations, such as WIC, to provide education to expecting and new mothers during a mom-baby health fair. (credit: “IMG_9210” by FNS Midwest/Flickr, Public Domain)
Partnerships may expand into a coalition. A coalition is a group of people and organizations that work to address community needs and solve community problems (PHAB, 2022). Coalitions connect multiple sectors within the community, such as schools, worksites, government, public health, hospital systems, community-based organizations, religious organizations, and the community at large (Society for Public Health Education [SOPHE], 2016). Coalitions help gain attention for the health problem; share knowledge, strategies, risks, and responsibilities; combine resources to address the health problem; assemble diverse talents and expertise; limit duplication of programs and services; and attain sustainability for health programs (Issel & Wells, 2018; SOPHE, 2016). Coalitions are strategic, formed in response to a specific health problem. For example, the program discussed in Theory in Action: Using the Community Action Model to Improve Infrastructure and Promote Physical Activity was accomplished by a coalition (Healthy Places by Design, 2016). The KidsWalk Coalition included members from schools, businesses, government agencies, youth organizations, community and faith-based organizations, and the New Orleans Department of Public Works. The specific health focus was to improve infrastructure and safety to make walking and biking an option for community members. 

Engage and Mobilize Community Partnerships
The nurse identifies and engages potential community partners and develops community partnerships before developing strategies for community health promotion and disease prevention programs.  describes the eight action steps and related activities the nurse uses to engage potential partners, mobilize community partnerships, and create community health coalitions.

Steps to Engage Community Partners and Create Coalitions
Identifying and engaging potential partners, which occurs in Steps 1 and 2, can be daunting, especially when there are few established partnerships and coalitions within the community. The nurse uses social networks to effectively engage potential partners. Social networks are linkages among individuals, groups, and organizations that arise out of geographical location, work relationships, school relationships, or recreational activities (Dozier et al., 2015). The nurse utilizes personal social networks to understand the individual, group, and organization's health priorities, recruit those with similar priorities, and solicit suggestions for other potential partners interested in the program. Social media provides an additional method to identify and engage potential partners. Social media is an effective engagement method in that it can be used to do the following (Walsh et al., 2021):
Search for individuals and community groups who post related content, such as health information and resources, policy advocacy, and discussions related to the targeted health problem
Disseminate information and program needs related to the targeted health problem
Expand reach to recruit community members from diverse groups and the target population
Provide a method to enhance communication among partners and coalitions by forming social media groups
Strategies to identify and engage potential partners more effectively include considering a potential partner's activities, accomplishments, current and potential contributions to health, individual and organizational self-interests, and possible conflicts (SOPHE, 2016). Partnerships and coalitions are more likely to succeed if specific interests and goals align and they can realistically achieve activities with minimal expense (Issel & Wells, 2018; HUD, 2012). Additionally, each partner should have a return on investment, benefiting from the partnership (HUD, 2012). The time and resources spent engaging in partnerships and relevant activities should help each partner meet their organization’s goals. 
Community asset mapping and partner analysis assist the nurse in identifying potential partnerships. Community asset mapping includes all community sectors with resources that could be utilized. The nurse completes an inventory of assets and the type of activities that potential individuals, organizations, or associations are engaged in. Assets may include the following (HUD, 2012):
Human resources, such as number, expertise, talent, and skills of staff
Physical resources, such as location to target population, public spaces, and meeting rooms
Information resources, such as educational materials and access to information resources
Political resources, such as elected officials and advocacy for policy change
Existing program resources, such as a program that has already been implemented 
Partner analysis uses that information to describe an organization’s experience with program planning and implementation, knowledge and expertise, available resources, influence on other partners, and potential roles and responsibilities for the program (WHO & UNICEF, 2020). JSI (2014) created a toolkit for partnership, collaboration, and action that provides tools to evaluate organizational readiness, identify barriers and challenges for partnerships, evaluate potential partners, and evaluate collaborative practices. 
During Step 3, the nurse develops partnership agreements with established partners. The partnership agreement may be a formal written agreement, such as a legal contract or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), or an informal verbal contract. The best approach is a written agreement, reviewed annually, that contains enough detail to evaluate whether each partner fulfilled their partnership commitment (JSI, 2014). This legally protects all partners’ best interests. JSI (2014) developed the Partnership Agreement Development Tool (PAD) to assist in developing a partnership agreement. The tool directs partners to address roles and responsibilities of each party in the relationship. 
Strategies to assist the nurse during Step 4, determine program priorities, and Step 5, develop an action plan, are described in sections below. 

Organize Teams with Shared Vision, Values, Principles, and Capacity for Community Action
The nurse is aware that team dynamics influence effective collaboration of partners during community program planning. Team dynamics refers to the relationships, interactions, attitudes, and behaviors that arise when a group of individuals work together. Positive team dynamics, such as open communication, conflict resolution, alignment of roles, commitment to the project, and optimism, improve both team and individual performance and enhance effectiveness to reach team goals (Sharma, 2023). 
Team Science: The Effective Team
Healthy team dynamics enhance a teams’ ability to communicate effectively, make decisions, and accomplish shared goals. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What are characteristics of a healthy team?
Why is setting team expectations important when working with a group? 
What are factors that make a team successful?
The nurse, partners, and other interested parties meet to develop a shared vision, values, principles, and capacity to clarify the team’s common interests and provide purpose, focus, and direction for program planning. A program vision is a statement that articulates the desired goals that the planning team aspires to achieve (PHAB, 2022; HUD, 2012). The vision should include diverse perspectives and be broad, inspiring, and easy to communicate (HUD, 2012). For example, The North Carolina Farmworker Health Program (NCFHP, 2023) has the following vision that directs collaboration with local agencies to meet the health needs of farmworkers: 
We envision a comprehensive network of health care professionals that provides culturally appropriate and accessible health services, empowering farmworkers and their families to live healthy lives as valued members of informed and inclusive communities.
When writing the program vision, the team answers the following questions:
What is the problem we are attempting to solve?
What are we hoping to achieve?
If we achieved all the goals, what would the community look like in the future?
A program’s values flow from the vision. Values are the core principles and beliefs that direct the team (PHAB, 2022). When writing the program values, the team answers the following questions:
What shared values are unique to our team?
What behaviors do we value that are related to the problem, health promotion, and disease prevention?
How will we implement our program activities to achieve our vision?
Although program documents may not explicitly note values, they are interwoven throughout activities and demonstrated in the program’s practices. For example, values evident in the NCFHP are health equity, cultural and linguistic competency, collaboration, access, and empowerment. 
Finally, the nurse, partners, and other interested parties define the program’s capacity. When determining program capacity, the team answers the following questions:
What resources can each partner and interested party contribute to the program?
Are there other resources in the community that could be utilized?
Is additional funding available, such as state or federal grant opportunities or community donors?
Are there other community relationships that could be established to increase capacity?
Are there barriers related to resources and relationships?
Cultivating Care
A community health program is developed according to the vision, values, and capacity of partners and other interested parties planning and implementing the program. The NCFHP demonstrates the incorporation of vision, values, and capacity by assisting local agencies in increasing access to health and dental care for farmworkers and their families. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What are some barriers to accessing health care the migrant workers faced? How did the NCFHP address them?
How has the NCFHP vision impacted program activities?
How are values incorporated into NCFHP activities?
How does the NCFHP build capacity?

Ethical Considerations Associated with Planning, Implementing, and Evaluating Community Programs
The program team must consider community health ethical principles and issues associated with program planning, implementation, and evaluation. Ethical and moral norms related to health care and community health are considered when planning program activities. The American Public Health Association (APHA, 2019) Public Health Code of Ethics provides an overview of ethical norms to consider. Accountability, participant protection, and incentive use are specific ethical topics that influence program planning decisions. Program planning, implementation, and evaluation teams are responsible for ensuring ethical and moral norms are upheld. Ethical analysis should occur in the beginning stages of program planning. 
Ethical and Moral Norms
The nurse and program team follow the Public Health Code of Ethics during program planning, implementation, and evaluation.  provides a description and application of ethical and moral standards that should be incorporated into program development and implementation.
Ethical Standard
Examples of Application
Professionalism and trust
Evidence from research and experience supports actions (APHA, 2019).
Program and activities have been shown to improve health practice and outcomes (APHA, 2019).
Program and program team are competent, honest, transparent, and accurate (APHA, 2019).
Secondary interests do not influence program choices (APHA, 2019).
Health and safety
Program and activities promote health and well-being, minimize harm, prevent disease, and promote safety (APHA, 2019; Akrami et al., 2018).
Health justice and equity
Program and activities equally distribute burdens, benefits, and opportunities for health (APHA, 2019; Akrami et al., 2018).
Program and activities do not exacerbate health inequity, including structural and institutional inequity (APHA, 2019).
Program and activities reduce social inequities (Akrami et al., 2018).
Interdependence and solidarity
Program and activities foster positive relationships within the community (APHA, 2019).
Human rights and civil liberties
Program participants have the right to personal autonomy, self-determination, and privacy (APHA, 2019; Akrami et al., 2018).
Inclusivity and engagement
Program engages individuals and communities affected by decision-making (APHA, 2019).
Decision-makers represent diverse community individuals, partners, and organizations (APHA, 2019).
Program empowers the community to make informed decisions and health changes (Akrami et al., 2018).
Ethical and Moral Norms to Consider During Program Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation
What is Health Equity?
Unequal access to resources leads to health disparities. Health disparities are health differences that negatively affect socially disadvantaged populations. Public health programs focus on eliminating health disparities by promoting health equity and health justice. Health equity gives individuals what they need to achieve equal health outcomes. Health justice is one method to achieve health equity and involves eliminating personal, community, political, and systematic barriers to equitable health outcomes. 
The video discusses causes of health inequity and provides recommendations to achieve health equity. Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
What causes health inequity?
What does the American Public Health Association recommend to reduce disparities and promote health justice and equity? 
Accountability
The nurse and program team consider professional and program accountability during partnership establishment, program planning, program intervention, and program evaluation. Professional accountability ensures that team members act within the scope of their professional license. Additionally, individuals within the team should have the appropriate training, skill, and supervision to ensure that the services and activities offered are the best available. For example, Jamie (the nurse) and the KHCFBP team asked a local bike expert and licensed educator to assist with activity planning and content delivery. This ensured that the right individual, with the needed knowledge, skill, and experience, was involved. 
The nurse and program team consider program accountability when developing the program’s vision, values, and activities. The program is accountable for upholding community health program standards, such as implementing activities that originate from health needs of the community, are delivered with efficient use of resources, reach the intended population, have been delivered as planned, are managed according to the planned budget, make the most impact, and follow local, state, and federal law (Issel & Wells, 2018). The program must be fiscally responsible, including efficient and appropriate use of funds. For example, funds that were donated to purchase bikes and bike helmets for a community health biking program must be used for that purpose. It would be unethical to use those funds in any other way. Finally, program accountability includes transparency, commitment, and sustainability of services (Akrami et al., 2018). The program should be implemented as promised and continue for as long as promised. For example, if a program offers free screening to community members, the program should have the resources to provide screening to all who qualify. 
Participant Protection
Participants’ privacy and autonomy should be protected throughout program implementation and evaluation. Community program participant information is only confidential by law under certain circumstances, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for health care systems and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for educational systems (Issel & Wells, 2018). Even if the community program does not fall within those categories, best practice is to only allow access to participants’ personal information for those working directly with participants or within reports required for funding purposes. At the beginning of the program, the nurse communicates circumstances where the team may share personal information and may attain informed consent for sharing of information. 
Participant autonomy is protected through disclosure and informed consent. The nurse discloses program conditions and activities, conflict of interest, policies regarding confidentiality, and if the program is a part of a research study. The participant also has the choice to participate in and withdraw from the program at any time. If the program is part of a research study, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval must be gained, and participants must consent to participate in the study. The IRB reviews evaluation and research plans to ensure ethical standards are followed and participant rights are protected. Consent includes ensuring participant understanding of the purpose of the study. Autonomy and informed consent issues arise in community health programs because many programs target vulnerable populations and children (Issel & Wells, 2018). Care must be taken in these situations to ensure that ethical standards are followed. 
Incentive Use
Using incentives in community health programs has been a highly debated topic. Incentives are used to motivate program participants to do something. Community health programs may use incentives to increase program enrollment and retention or adoption of health promotion and disease prevention behaviors. Four types of incentives have been used in community health programs (CDC, 2021):
Cash incentives: providing cash to a person or direct depositing funds into a bank account
Noncash financial incentives: providing items that have cash value, such as gift cards, vouchers, or insurance premium discounts
Nonfinancial incentives: providing items that have value, but not cash value, such as prizes, products, or memberships
Mixed incentives: providing a combination of above 
Incentives reward behavior in the short-term, which people most often prefer, and so increase the likelihood of behavior in the short-term (CDC, 2021). Incentives may also provide motivation to adopt a healthy behavior, but this depends upon the complexity of the behavior change (CDC, 2021). For example, an incentive for simple behaviors, such as attending a meeting for weight loss, may be more successful than an incentive for complex behaviors, such as losing 20 pounds. Complex behaviors take more time, effort, and consistent change than simple ones, so the incentive may not align with the complexity. Programs that use incentives have been found to have higher levels of attendance and increased adoption of health behaviors compared to those that do not, but these results have varied according to race (CDC, 2021). Because of this, it is important to include members of the target population in decision-making regarding incentive use. 
Factors to consider before adoption of the use of incentives include the following (CDC, 2021):
Program setting and participants—Types of incentives may work in some settings and populations but not in others.
Maintenance of change—Behaviors may not continue when incentives have stopped, so strategies to maintain behavior change should be incorporated into the program.
Incentive type, amount, and frequency—Determine whether to use financial or nonfinancial incentives and how much incentive is needed to motivate participants as well as how often incentives will be given.
Measurement method—Decide whether to provide incentives only for behaviors that can be measured rather than those that require self-reporting.
Ethical Analysis of Community Programs
The nurse appraises community programs to ensure ethical norms are maintained. The APHA (2019) offers a list of questions that can be used to analyze the ethics of a community program.  lists ethical standards and associated questions.

Four types of incentives have been used in community health programs (CDC, 2021):
Cash incentives: providing cash to a person or direct depositing funds into a bank account
Noncash financial incentives: providing items that have cash value, such as gift cards, vouchers, or insurance premium discounts
Nonfinancial incentives: providing items that have value, but not cash value, such as prizes, products, or memberships
Mixed incentives: providing a combination of above 
Incentives reward behavior in the short-term, which people most often prefer, and so increase the likelihood of behavior in the short-term (CDC, 2021). Incentives may also provide motivation to adopt a healthy behavior, but this depends upon the complexity of the behavior change (CDC, 2021). For example, an incentive for simple behaviors, such as attending a meeting for weight loss, may be more successful than an incentive for complex behaviors, such as losing 20 pounds. Complex behaviors take more time, effort, and consistent change than simple ones, so the incentive may not align with the complexity. Programs that use incentives have been found to have higher levels of attendance and increased adoption of health behaviors compared to those that do not, but these results have varied according to race (CDC, 2021). Because of this, it is important to include members of the target population in decision-making regarding incentive use. 
Factors to consider before adoption of the use of incentives include the following (CDC, 2021):
Program setting and participants—Types of incentives may work in some settings and populations but not in others.
Maintenance of change—Behaviors may not continue when incentives have stopped, so strategies to maintain behavior change should be incorporated into the program.
Incentive type, amount, and frequency—Determine whether to use financial or nonfinancial incentives and how much incentive is needed to motivate participants as well as how often incentives will be given.
Measurement method—Decide whether to provide incentives only for behaviors that can be measured rather than those that require self-reporting.

Ethical Analysis of Community Programs
The nurse appraises community programs to ensure ethical norms are maintained. The APHA (2019) offers a list of questions that can be used to analyze the ethics of a community program.  lists ethical standards and associated questions. 
Ethical Standard & Description
Example of Question for Assessment (APHA, 2019)

Socially and culturally appropriate
Within the standard of the law
Is the action (program or program activity) ethically wrong, even if the action’s outcome is good?
Respect
Supports human dignity within transactions, exchanges, and relationships
Relates to values of justice, equity, interdependence, and solidarity
Is the action (program or program activity) demeaning or disrespectful to individuals or communities, even if it benefits health?
Reciprocity
Cooperation and mutual exchange
Reasonable burden
Does the action (program or program activity) outweigh the potential harm and loss that is imposed on individuals and communities?
Effectiveness
Achievement of the intended public health goal
Is it expected that the action (program or program activity) will achieve its stated goals based on evidence and experience?
Responsible use of resources
Resources such as human skill, expertise, and time; equipment and supplies; natural resources; infrastructure; and funds
Does the action (program or program activity) show efficient and effective use of resources that could be used for other actions?
Proportionality
Equitable and fair
Does not benefit one group more than another
Decreases inequities and disparities
Are the program planners, implementers, and evaluators using power and authority appropriately?
Does the action (program or program activity) distribute costs and benefits in an equitable, fair, and nondiscriminatory way?
Does the action (program or program activity) benefit few and cause harm to many?
Accountability and Transparency
Builds trust with individuals and communities
Demonstrates respect for affected communities and partners
Do the program planners, implementers, and evaluators provide a rationale for the action (program or program activity)?
Has the action (program or program activity) been analyzed ethically and determined to be ethical?
Public participation
Meaningful involvement of members of the public
Ensures participants and decision-makers are mutually informed and engaged in dialogue and exchange
Have partners and community members had the opportunity to participate in decision-making?
Assessment of Ethical Standards in Community Programs

Chapter Summary
A participatory approach plays a key role in the success of community health programs. The nurse engages members of the target population, organizations, and other interested parties by creating partnerships and coalitions. The nurse uses various strategies to identify and recruit partners, such as social networking, community mapping, and partner analysis. Established program partners develop a shared vision, values, and capacity for the community health program. The team also considers ethical standards and potential ethical issues throughout program planning, implementation, and evaluation.

If the program is part of a research study, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval must be gained, and participants must consent to participate in the study. The IRB reviews evaluation and research plans to ensure ethical standards are followed and participant rights are protected. Consent includes ensuring participant understanding of the purpose of the study. Autonomy and informed consent issues arise in community health programs because many programs target vulnerable populations and children (Issel & Wells, 2018).

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Differentiate between goals, objectives, and outcomes.
Utilize Healthy People 2030 national goals and measurable objectives to guide evidence-based policies, programs, and other actions to improve health and well-being.
Create an action plan inclusive of mutual goals and measurable objectives, considering strategic plans and evaluation methods.

Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes in Program Planning
The nurse and program team create goals, objectives, and outcomes before developing the action plan. Goals are statements that explain the program’s purpose and what the program plans to accomplish (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2018; Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention [DHDSP], 2017). Goals align with the identified health problem, vision, and program values. Goals are achieved through program objectives and activities. For example, the overarching goal of the KHCFBP, mentioned throughout the chapter, was to increase physical activity of adults, adolescents, and children through biking. 
Objectives are statements of specific actions or behaviors that lead to accomplishing program goals (SAMHSA, 2018; DHDSP, 2017). Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) in order to provide clarity, establish accountability, focus timing, communicate realistic expectations, and direct evaluation (DHDSP, 2017). SMART objectives can be short-term, intermediate, or long-term and can be related to process or outcomes. Process objectives direct activities to be completed in a specific time frame and describe participants, interactions, and activities (DHDSP, 2017). Outcome objectives state the intended results of activities or the program, focusing on changes in knowledge, skills, and attitudes of participants and community members or changes in policies, systems, or environments (DHDSP, 2017). For example, the KHCFBP team wrote objectives to provide clarity, accountability, and focus for the program activities.  provides examples of short-term, intermediate, and long-term objectives based on the KHCFBP goals. 
KHCFBP Goal
Increase physical activity of adults, adolescents, and children through biking.
Increase adult, adolescent, and child knowledge, skill, confidence, and safety associated with biking.
Process Objectives
By August 31, 2018, complete two sessions of the KHCFPB.
By August 31, 2018, reach up to 80 parents/guardians, adolescents, and children participating in the KHCFPB.
By August 31, 2018, 100 percent of participants will attend and complete all planned activities.
By August 31, 2018, form at least five strategic partnerships in program planning, implementation, and/or evaluation.
By August 31, 2018, distribute one bike and one bike helmet to each program participant.
Outcome Objectives*
*Use baseline data if possible.
The KHCFBP was a new program, so no baseline data were available for short-term and intermediate objectives.
Short-term
By the end of each session (July 14, 2018, or August 25, 2018), increase participant bike safety knowledge from pre-program to post-program.
By the end of each session (July 14, 2018, or August 25, 2018), attain a positive participant view of the bike program.
Intermediate
By 30 days post-program (August 13, 2018, or September 24, 2018), increase participant bike helmet use from pre-program.
By 30 days post-program (August 13, 2018, or September 24, 2018), increase participant biking frequency from pre-program.
By 30 days post-program (August 13, 2018, or September 24, 2018), increase participant physical activity from pre-program.
Long-term
*Physical activity was chosen in this case because biking frequency is not measured in county community health assessment.
By August 31, 2023, increase physical activity of Hardin County adults from 30 percent meeting national physical activity goals of at least 30 minutes on five or more days per week to at least 33 percent.
By August 31, 2023, increase physical activity of Hardin County youth from 29 percent meeting national physical activity goals of at least 60 minutes daily to at least 32 percent.
By August 31, 2023, maintain at least five strategic partnerships gained with the KHCFBP.
By August 31, 2023, offer at least five additional sessions of the KHCFBP.
Examples of the KHCFBP’s Process Objectives and Short-Term, Intermediate, and Long-Term Outcome Objectives

Writing SMART Objectives
The SMART method is one approach to ensure that the objectives of community health programs are well-written. Well-written objectives answer “WHO is going to do WHAT, WHEN, and TO WHAT EXTENT?” (DHDSP, 2017, p. 2). The SMART method is used to determine whether the program has achieved what it intended (see ).
S
Specific
Identifies the target population or setting and actions
M
Measurable
Identifies what will be measured and includes baseline data if available
A
Attainable/Achievable
Evaluates the feasibility of achievement in relation to available resources, time frame, and support
R
Relevant/Realistic
Relates the relationship between the objective and overall goal
T
Time-bound
Identifies a reasonable and achievable time frame for accomplishment
Objectives Using the SMART Approach
The nurse and program team use baseline data to determine change, so it is included within the objective. Baseline data can be local information, such as data gathered during community health assessment, or state or national information, such as data within state health assessment reports, national health data sites, or Healthy People 2030. Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis discusses methods for gathering baseline data. At times, baseline data is not available. In those instances, it should be stated that baseline data will be gathered as a first activity of the program (DHDSP, 2017).
The nurse and program team determine relevancy and reasonableness by gathering evidence for program activities. Literature, best practice, and theory provide rationale that the objective, and activities stemming from the objective, directly lead to change (DHDSP, 2017). DHDSP (2017) has developed a guide for writing SMART objectives that can be used by the nurse and program team. 

Healthy People 2030 in Program Planning
The nurse and program team can use Healthy People 2030 to establish a baseline for measurement, align objectives with national leading health indicators and priorities, address SDOH, and find evidence-based resources to address identified community health problems. Health People 2030 includes evidence by topic related to health conditions, health behavior, population, setting and system, and social determinants of health. It also includes Healthy People in Action posts to describe how communities are implementing evidence-based programs based on Healthy People 2030 goals and objectives. This evidence provides a rationale for the choice of community health program goals, objectives, outcomes, and activities. 
Physical Activity: Evidence-Based Resources
Healthy People 2030 provides national goals and objectives and evidence-based resources for action. Review the Healthy People 2030 physical activity objectives and resources to see examples of current national goals and the 31 evidence-based resources related to physical activity. Most resources describe community health programs that have successfully changed physical activity health behaviors and health outcomes.

Create an Action Plan
The nurse and program team determine program goals and objectives and search for potential evidence-based strategies to meet objectives before creating the program action plan. An action plan provides concrete steps of strategy implementation to achieve program goals and objectives. A written action plan improves efficiency and accountability, helps the team ensure all program details are considered, and provides credibility for program strategies. An action plan should be complete, communicating every step of the program implementation and plan for evaluation; clear; and current. The action plan is a work in progress and may be revised as resource availability and community needs change. The team may also modify the action plan if processes and activities are not working as planned. 
The action plan includes health promotion and disease prevention interventions based on assessment data, health behavioral change and health promotion theories, relevant literature, and input from community members, partners, and the target population (Fernandez et al., 2019). The team writes action steps for each program objective and includes information regarding what intervention will occur, who will carry it out, when the intervention will take place and for how long, what resources are needed to carry out interventions, and what communication should occur (CDC, 2013). According to Issel and Wells (2018), the nurse and program team should choose interventions that
are evidence-based and have been proven to reduce the identified health problem;
are tailored to the target population, including cultural and linguistic appropriateness, learning needs, and motivation level;
lead to improved health outcomes;
are flexible with the ability to adjust activities to the participants’ needs;
are technologically and logistically practical;
are of reasonable cost;
are acceptable to participants, partners, and policymakers; and
address community priorities.
In addition to interventions, the nurse and program team consider potential barriers to the action plan, communication strategies, and plan for evaluation, all of which are discussed in detail in Implementation and Evaluation Considerations. The program team identifies potential barriers to address before implementation, such as resource availability, time involved to carry out actions, and community support (CDC, 2013). As part of the action plan, the program team plans strategies for communication. This includes what needs to be communicated and to whom, as well as accountability, method, and timing for communication (CDC, 2013). Examples of communication include program advertisement and recruitment, updates to the program team and partners, and dissemination of the program evaluation. The CDC offers a program planning workbook to assist in an action plan and communication strategy development. Finally, the nurse and program team plan for the evaluation of the process and outcome objectives to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of program implementation and to improve and account for program decisions and actions.
The goal of any community health program is to motivate and empower the community to adopt healthy behaviors and reduce unhealthy ones. The nurse, throughout the process of program planning, engages the community through partnerships and coalitions to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of program interventions. Health promotion, disease prevention, and behavior change theories and models are also used to increase effectiveness in achieving program goals. The nurse and program team choose evidence-based, relevant, and current interventions to enhance opportunities for success. Finally, the process and outcomes of program planning and implementation are evaluated to determine if program revisions are needed to ensure the achievement of goals and objectives.

Chapter Summary
The final steps of program planning involve the creation of program goals, objectives, outcomes, and an action plan. Goals explain the program’s overarching purpose, and objectives describe specific actions that will lead to the achievement of program goals. Well-written objectives are SMART, include both process and outcomes, and have short-term, intermediate, and long-term time frames for achievement. The action plan is a step-by-step strategy for the implementation of evidence-based intervention. Healthy People 2030 can be used to search for relevant, current, and evidence-based interventions.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Examine the meaning of culture in the nursing context.
Explain cultural identity.
Discuss the importance of culture and cultural identity to achieving the goals of population health. 
Discuss the concept of cultural humility and its significance to nursing.
Explain how cultural humility and cultural awareness affect nursing care.

Culture
Culture is learned in a dynamic process passed from generation to generation, shaping a person’s beliefs, influencing their behaviors, and playing a large role in shaping their identities (Giger & Davidhizar, 2002). Individuals within a cultural group share common values, beliefs, and norms that influence their responses to the world around them. Amish communities in Pennsylvania and transgender youth are examples of cultural groups. Everyone, regardless of where they are born or live, belongs to one or more cultures.
Although cultures consist of many people, every individual behaves differently depending on their own circumstances and experiences. This makes it impossible to pick one person from a cultural group as a “typical” example of that group. On a smaller scale, think of how different two siblings in the same family can be.

Cultural Identity
Cultural identity is the unique combination of beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, customs, practices, and language that make up an individual’s sense of belonging to a particular cultural group. Like culture, cultural identity is fluid and can change throughout a person’s lifetime. How? Cultural identity can be influenced by factors such as migration, globalization, social forces, interpersonal relationships, and individual experiences. Each person’s cultural identity is an important aspect of their self-concept, encompassing who they are, how they fit into society, and what their larger context is within the human experience. All nurses bring their unique cultural identities to every client encounter, and all clients do the same.
Let’s return to Cory’s work with Mrs. Rodriguez. Mrs. Rodriguez moved to another country, the United States, to involve her family in her health care, something she considers vitally important. Family involvement is a part of Mrs. Rodriguez’s cultural identity. The priority Cory places on adapting to his client’s needs is a part of his cultural identity as a nurse. Why? It’s something Cory has learned, supported by his commitment to evidence-based practice. It shapes his role as a health care professional, affecting his interactions with clients and his decisions about how to approach client care.
Culture significantly influences many aspects of life, including the health of individuals and of populations. Population health emphasizes equitable access and quality of care regardless of a person’s background. Nurses who recognize and respond to the role culture plays in client health provide higher quality care and achieve better outcomes for their clients. The ability of a nurse to provide safe, quality care regardless of cultural identities depends on developing cultural sensitivity, cultural awareness, and cultural humility, and that process begins with an examination of their own attitudes, values, and beliefs. See Cultural Influences on Health Beliefs and Practices for more information on cultural identity.

Cultural Humility and Cultural Awareness
Cultural humility refers to being open-minded and reflective about one’s own values and beliefs, along with acknowledging, respecting, and valuing cultural differences. A nurse practicing cultural humility will demonstrate a desire to understand other perspectives. Developing cultural humility begins with self-reflection, open communication, and collaboration with diverse groups and populations. Yet this isn’t enough—cultural humility also requires awareness of one’s own biases and how they may impact interactions with people from other backgrounds.
One way to learn about cultural humility is to explore and come to appreciate different cultures and their beliefs and values. Although no one can possess knowledge of every culture they interact with, to provide quality care, nurses should strive for cultural awareness. Cultural awareness in nursing is defined as “the process of understanding and respecting the beliefs, customs, languages, and values of clients from diverse cultures” (Giger & Haddad, 2020). It recognizes that culture shapes perspectives and experiences, influences the way people express themselves, and acknowledges that a client’s or group’s cultural norms may differ from those most often found in conventional health care settings. Cultural awareness is rooted in values such as openness, fairness, and mutual understanding.
Evidence shows that when nurses engage in positive, respectful, trusting, and caring interactions with clients, these clients experience better health outcomes. To develop such relationships with a broad range of people from varied backgrounds, nurses must become culturally aware and engage in cultural humility. Respectful relationships prioritize client self-determination and promote greater equity. They are at the heart of providing culturally and linguistically responsive nursing care.

Chapter Summary
Individuals and groups pass culture from one generation to the next in a dynamic process that influences a person’s actions and helps to shape their identities, roles, and lifeways. Cultural identity is the unique combination of beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, customs, practices, experiences, and language that make up an individual’s sense of belonging to a particular group. To provide culturally and linguistically responsive nursing care, nurses must develop cultural humility and awareness and prioritize client self-determination.

By understanding and respecting the cultural beliefs and values of their clients, nurses can build trust and rapport, leading to improved communication and better health outcomes. Cultural awareness also helps nurses to recognize and address potential barriers to care, such as language differences, religious practices, and health beliefs. Ultimately, integrating cultural humility and cultural awareness into nursing practice promotes a more inclusive and effective approach to healthcare delivery, ensuring that all individuals receive care that is respectful of their cultural identities and responsive to their unique needs.","i ssta  nurses t eecultua arens t ie hlis piencetere ce.  derstadng and resece cultural e and ae i cltura uil tu an rort lent edmnation and etter heat oo ultural aarenes a hels nuss to egnean  tentia airocess a ifences ros actis and helth eietitel, iea ultural iity an lal aes io us practice perencs and aa thatae dive ening tat all iniial reive care  s eelo cultural idenes and roie t teinin.",37.2865275142315,"nurses develop cultural and care. and the and their and and to and care, cultural humility and awareness and",13.194444444444445, better health outcomes. ,2.083333333333333

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe culturally responsive care.
Explain the basic concepts of culturally competent nursing care.
Discuss the relationship between cultural competence and health outcomes. 
Describe how valuing and respecting diversity affect health care.

Cultural Competence and Culturally Congruent Care
Culturally responsive care is one potential outcome of the dynamic process of cultural competence. Although many definitions of cultural competence exist, this chapter uses the one adopted by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing: “cultural competence encompasses the attitudes, knowledge, and skills necessary for providing quality care to diverse populations” (AACN, 2008, p. 1).
The concept of cultural competence in nursing has its roots in the work of Cross et al. (1989) and has since expanded to encompass critical components for effective cross-cultural interactions, such as cultural awareness, cultural humility, and cultural sensitivity. The idea of cultural competence in nursing care can be traced back to Leininger’s book Nursing and Anthropology: Two Worlds to Blend (1970). As discussed in Transcultural Nursing, the field of transcultural nursing has since grown, generating a major theory, several models, and hundreds of research studies. As a result, professional organizations and educational institutions have begun incorporating cultural competence into their policies, standards, and curricula (Marion et al., 2016).
In 2014 the American Nurses Association formed a work group of 40 expert nurses to review and revise the 2010 version of the nursing scope and standards of practice (American Nurses Association, 2010). The work group reviewed all scope statements and standards in light of the increasing cultural and ethnic diversity in health care and the rise in humanitarian needs. Recognizing the necessity for nurses to have expert guidance on how to provide culturally congruent care, or care that is aligned with a client’s culture, the work group developed a new Standard 8, Culturally Congruent Practice, to describe “nursing care that is in agreement with the preferred values, beliefs, worldview, and practices of the healthcare consumer” (American Nurses Association, 2015, p. 31). This standard sets expectations for nurses’ education, legal responsibilities, and societal obligations. Cultural congruence is a fundamental part of nursing practice and is integral to the agreement between the profession and society. Standard 8 elevates the entire nursing profession within this agreement and provides guidance for implementation by practicing nurses (Marion et al., 2016).
The latest research emphasizes the importance of improving nurses’ ability to provide culturally congruent care (Im & Chee, 2021). Culturally congruent care is the implementation of evidence-based nursing practice that recognizes and is consistent with the values, beliefs, worldviews, and practices of clients and populations, with the goal of improving health outcomes (Marion et al., 2016). It is customized to the needs of the client, group, or population. For example, a client with diabetes tells their nurse that they come from a culture with different health beliefs and practices and that they frequently consult with a traditional healer about their dietary choices. To provide culturally congruent care, the nurse prioritizes the client’s beliefs and practices, collaborating with them to identify culturally appropriate foods and traditions, and then incorporates these preferences into the care plan. The nurse can then provide culturally responsive education to the client about their dietary choices and encourage them to continue incorporating healthy practices that are congruent with their culture.
Several critiques of cultural competence have emerged. While some health care professionals consider the process of cultural competence an imperative for reducing health inequities, others argue that it is based on ethnocentrism, a belief that one’s own cultural values, traditions, and practices are superior to those of other cultures (Beser et al., 2021). According to this critique, the ethnocentric orientation of cultural competence can lead to stereotyping and, as a result, perpetuate already existing biases and inequities (Berger & Ribeiro Miller, 2021). Other critics argue that the process of developing cultural competence oversimplifies the complex nature of culture, reducing it to facts and easily acquired knowledge while failing to consider cultural change and variability (Campinha-Bacote, 2018). A recent shift toward culturally responsive care focuses on nurses’ ability to recognize and respond inclusively to diverse perspectives, and it emphasizes the importance of social justice (Day & Beard, 2019).

The Significance of Culturally Responsive Nursing
A nurse’s ability to provide effective, culturally responsive nursing care begins by exploring their own attitudes, beliefs, and values and involves an ongoing reflective process with the aim of providing culturally congruent care (Leininger, 1991, 1999). Nurses are not expected to know everything about every culture; acquiring such knowledge would be impossible. Although it is important for nurses to be aware of the different cultural groups prevalent in the areas where they practice, the only way to be certain of a client’s or population’s beliefs is to approach them with an open mind, inquire about preferences and needs, and listen with empathy and humility.
As the U.S. population becomes more diverse, cultural competence becomes increasingly important in health care. Studies have shown that when nurses provide care that responds to a client’s or population’s health beliefs and behaviors, they demonstrate more empathy, communicate more effectively, and provide more substantive client education (Sharifi, 2019). Nurses who practice this way can more readily navigate challenging situations when providing care for diverse populations. They are more likely to be aware of potential biases that can come into play when delivering care and are more likely and better able to take steps to minimize those biases. Building relationships of trust between communities and health care professionals can help ensure that individuals receive the appropriate care they need, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or differences. Incorporating culturally competent care is essential for promoting health equity, particularly for underserved groups that have faced significant health disparities and increased rates of illness and mortality. Culturally competent care therefore serves as a means of advocating for these clients’ health and well-being (Pacquiao et al., 2023).
By understanding their clients’ unique cultural needs, nurses can provide more effective and personalized care that encourages client collaboration and engagement. Culturally responsive care facilitates better communication between nurses and clients, improved health management, increased adherence to treatment plans, and greater client satisfaction, all of which can lead to improved health outcomes.
Social Determinants of Health and Health Inequities
Effective culturally responsive care relies on nurses’ understanding of the social determinants of health, which are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, along with the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life that influence health outcomes. As discussed in The Social Determinants of Health, these conditions include income, education, housing, environment, employment, and access to health care. Social determinants of health can create significant health inequities (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.-b). The unequal distribution of health care services, quality of care, and health status among groups is based on factors such as race, ethnicity, culture, gender, ability, and socioeconomic status.
Health inequities are persistent across the United States. These inequities can follow a person from before birth throughout their lifespan, affecting the health and well-being of communities as well as individuals. Although their causes are systemic, health inequities are preventable. Culturally responsive nurses employ an understanding of the roots of health inequities to reduce them.
For example, some communities with high poverty levels are considered “food deserts,” areas where access to affordable and nutritious food is limited or nonexistent. Food deserts can occur due to a lack of grocery stores or farmers’ markets in the area, inadequate transportation options, or low income levels that make it difficult for residents to afford fresh, healthy food (). Food deserts are a serious public health concern because they can contribute to various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
People living in food deserts are often forced to rely on convenience stores and fast-food restaurants, which tend to offer unhealthy food options that are high in calories, fat, and sodium, resulting in a higher prevalence of chronic diseases.

A nurse who recognizes and considers the client’s environment will understand the impact of a food desert on the local community and can provide education and resources to help people obtain nutritious food and make healthier choices. They can also advocate for increased availability of nutritious foods in places such as corner stores, promote the incorporation of healthy foods into school meal programs, and work with clients to identify foods that are important to their cultural backgrounds and traditions.
Health inequities became especially apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Black, Hispanic, Native American/Alaskan Indian, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals had a 1.5 times greater risk of contracting the infection than White individuals and were twice as likely to die. Various factors contributed to the higher disease and death rates, including greater exposure to the pathogen for essential workers, greater proportions of people living in crowded conditions, less access to health care, and a greater burden of chronic diseases (Alcendor, 2020).
Racial and ethnic minorities endure higher rates of morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. For example, the tuberculosis rate among Native Americans is nearly eight times greater than that among White Americans, at 4.4 vs. 0.3 cases per 100,000 people (Schildknecht et al., 2023). Life expectancy for Native Americans is 5.5 years lower than the national average, at 71.8 vs. 78.8 years (Arias et al., 2021). A higher proportion of rural adult Black and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals (40.3 percent for both groups) report having multiple chronic health conditions compared with non-Hispanic White individuals (36 percent). Individuals with chronic conditions need more health care and interact more frequently with health care providers and services; those without a primary care provider are less likely to have their chronic conditions managed. Although chronic illness is more prevalent among racial and ethnic minorities, in rural areas, for example, only 61.5 percent of Hispanic and 63.7 percent of Native American individuals report having a primary care provider.
Younger Black adults live with and succumb to health conditions typically seen in White Americans in old age. For example, 33 percent of Black adults aged 35 to 49 have diagnosed hypertension, compared with 22 percent of White adults in the same age group (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Diabetes rates show an even greater disparity: 10 percent of Black adults have diabetes compared with 6 percent of White adults. Among children, asthma prevalence in Black children (18.1 percent) and Native American/Native Alaskan children (18.0 percent) is nearly twice that of White children (9.5 percent), and it is alarmingly high among children of Puerto Rican descent (23.6 percent) (Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2020). Early onset of these conditions leads to greater morbidity and earlier mortality. The challenges presented by structural racism and the social determinants of health are covered in more detail in Unit 2, Issues and Challenges of Population Health.
Culturally Responsive Care and Health Inequities
Culturally responsive care increases client satisfaction, reduces health inequities, and leads to improved outcomes. By promoting respect and understanding between nurses and clients, cultural humility and culturally responsive care can help reduce inequities because the client is more likely to understand, collaborate, and follow the recommended care plan, regardless of their background or circumstances.
Consider this example of the effects of culturally responsive care. Although Black newborns are more than twice as likely to die as White newborns (1,090 vs. 490 deaths per 100,000 births), this number is halved when the physician providing care to the newborn is also Black. This difference may be due to Black physicians’ recognition and understanding of the unique challenges and needs of babies born to mothers already prone to poorer health outcomes (Greenwood, 2020).
Health outcomes also improve when community preferences and needs are considered. Native Americans experience multiple structural inequities, including discrimination, poverty, forced relocation, and a history of trauma, all of which play a role in the high rates of substance abuse among some Native populations. In addition to these challenges, Native American communities often have limited access to quality health care services, including substance abuse treatment and mental health services. Nurses are responding to this need by advocating for culturally adapted, locally based interventions. For example, the Native Alaskan Yup’ik community-initiated alcohol abuse prevention program Qungasavik was developed as a toolbox for building on Native community strengths (Rasmus et al., 2014). Similarly, work by the Native Transformations Project identified the importance of family, community, and spirituality as protective factors against substance abuse (Rasmus et al., 2016).
Read the scenario and then reflect on the questions that follow.
Cory, the community health nurse introduced at the start of this chapter, is meeting another new client in the clinic today. Faiza is a married 28-year-old woman who is trying to establish primary and obstetric care. Cory is scheduled to meet with Faiza to assist her in arranging for appropriate and timely care and to assess whether she needs other health-related resources. When Cory goes to the waiting room and calls Faiza’s name, a man rises from his seat, and only then does the young woman seated beside him move her head and stand. The woman, who is wearing a hijab head covering, walks behind the man to the front of the room where Cory is waiting. The man says, “She is Faiza.” Faiza does not look directly at Cory. Cory reaches his hand out to Faiza and says, “Hi, my name is Cory, and I’m the nurse you’re seeing today; nice to meet you.” Faiza does not look up and does not take Cory’s hand. She says nothing and takes a small step backward. The man, who appears to be upset, says, “She needs a woman nurse. And she does not speak English, but I always translate for her.”
Why do you think the man with Faiza requests a woman nurse?
Does anything about this scenario make you uncomfortable? If so, consider why.
What additional information should Cory obtain before proceeding?
How should Cory respond to the statements “She needs a woman nurse . . . she does not speak English . . . I always translate for her”?
What does the client’s nonverbal communication (no eye contact, no handshaking, backward step) signify?
If the clinic cannot provide this client with a woman nurse, how should Cory proceed?
Do you think Cory should have done anything differently from the beginning?

Native Americans experience multiple structural inequities, including discrimination, poverty, forced relocation, and a history of trauma, all of which play a role in the high rates of substance abuse among some Native populations. In addition to these challenges, Native American communities often have limited access to quality health care services, including substance abuse treatment and mental health services. Nurses are responding to this need by advocating for culturally adapted, locally based interventions. For example, the Native Alaskan Yup’ik community-initiated alcohol abuse prevention program Qungasavik was developed as a toolbox for building on Native community strengths (Rasmus et al., 2014). Similarly, work by the Native Transformations Project identified the importance of family, community, and spirituality as protective factors against substance abuse (Rasmus et al., 2016). Read the scenario and then reflect on the questions that follow. Cory, the community health nurse introduced at the start of this chapter, is meeting another new client in the clinic today. Faiza is a married 28-year-old woman who is trying to establish primary and obstetric care. Cory is scheduled to meet with Faiza to assist her in arranging for appropriate and timely care and to assess whether she needs other health-related resources. When Cory goes to the waiting room and calls Faiza’s name, a man rises from his seat, and only then does the young woman seated beside him move her head and stand. The woman, who is wearing a hijab head covering, walks behind the man to the front of the room where Cory is waiting. The man says, “She is Faiza.” Faiza does not look directly at Cory. Cory reaches his hand out to Faiza and says, “Hi, my name is Cory, and I’m the nurse you’re seeing today; nice to meet you.” Faiza does not look up and does not take Cory’s hand. She says nothing and takes a small step backward. The man, who appears to be upset, says, “She needs a woman nurse. And she does not speak English, but I always translate for her.” Why do you think the man with Faiza requests a woman nurse? Does anything about this scenario make you uncomfortable? If so, consider why. What additional information should Cory obtain before proceeding? How should Cory respond to the statements “She needs a woman nurse . . . she does not speak English . . . I always translate for her”? What does the client’s nonverbal communication (no eye contact, no handshaking, backward step) signify? If the clinic cannot provide this client with a woman nurse, how should Cory proceed? Do you think Cory should have done anything differently from the beginning?

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Identify factors that affect communication with clients from diverse backgrounds.
Compare and contrast communication patterns in high- and low-context cultures.
Explain the effects of low health literacy on health outcomes.
Use effective communication strategies with clients with low literacy and low health literacy.

Differences in Communication Styles
Cultural variations in communication can significantly affect how health care professionals and clients interact and how individuals understand and interpret messages. Nurses need to understand how communication styles differ across cultures. By adapting their communication to align with the client’s preferences, nurses can avoid potential misunderstandings and communicate more effectively with clients from different backgrounds.
Tone, volume, and speed of speech vary among cultures. Loud, fast, and expressive speech is customary for some individuals, whereas others may perceive it as rude or aggressive. Clients from some cultures may consider it rude or disrespectful to make eye contact while speaking to a health care provider, whereas others may consider it a sign of attentiveness and respect. In some cultures, low facial expressiveness is considered typical, whereas other cultures may view it as indicating a lack of interest or even resistance. Culture can also influence the level of emotional expressiveness considered appropriate in social interactions. Some clients may be more open about discussing their feelings and expressing emotions, whereas others may consider it inappropriate to show strong emotions in public or to discuss their health with people who are not close friends or family. As always, it is important to follow the client’s cues in order to provide culturally and linguistically responsive care.
Cultural differences in communication can impact the way that people understand and interpret messages. For example, in high-context cultures, such as those found in Latin American and Asian countries, communication tends to be more subtle and rely more on nonverbal cues and context. Words alone may not convey the full meaning of a message, so nurses should consider the context and relationships between people when communicating. In addition, it may be considered rude or disrespectful to be overly direct, particularly when discussing negative or embarrassing topics; instead, these cultures may use more subtle and implicit language, with a focus on harmony and the interpersonal relationship. In contrast, in low-context cultures, such as those found in North America and Northern Europe, people tend to be more direct in their communication, using clear and explicit language.
In some cultures, communication is more oriented toward the self, whereas in others it is more focused on other people. This difference can be seen in the way people use “I” statements versus third-person language and plural pronouns. In the United States, where the dominant cultural norm is individualistic, people tend to speak in terms of their own experiences and preferences. In contrast, many other cultural groups are more collectivistic, meaning they prioritize the needs and perspectives of the group or community over those of the individual. For members of these cultures, it may be more common to speak in the third person and to use plural pronouns, such as “we” or “they,” rather than “I.”

Health Literacy
Health literacy—the ability to access, understand, and use health information and services to make informed decisions about one’s health—ensures that individuals are empowered to take positive actions to improve their health and well-being. Individuals who are health literate can understand and use health-related information and services. Health literacy enables people to read and comprehend medical instructions and labels, follow a treatment plan, and communicate effectively with health care providers, all of which can lead to better health outcomes. Health literacy can also reduce health care costs by preventing unnecessary hospitalizations and other costly interventions. Additionally, health literacy is important for reducing health disparities and promoting health equity.
Research has demonstrated that health literacy can have numerous positive impacts on health care (Shahid et al., 2022). Health literacy increases the use of preventive health care, reduces unnecessary emergency department visits and preventable hospital stays and readmissions, decreases medication errors, and assists clients in better managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, and HIV/AIDS. Moreover, it can increase client satisfaction, improve overall health outcomes, and enhance client safety, and it results in greater cost savings for the health care system (McDonald & Shenkman, 2018).
Increasing the Health Literacy of the U.S. Population
One overarching goal of Healthy People 2030 is to remove health disparities and improve health literacy in all people (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.-a). Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, and use health information and services to make informed decisions about one’s health. Healthy People 2030 identifies health literacy as being vital to reaching all Healthy People 2030 objectives. However, health information can be difficult to understand, especially in those with limited English proficiency. Healthy People 2030 has expanded its definition of health literacy to emphasize not only things individuals can do to improve health literacy but also the role that organizations play in helping individuals find, comprehend, and use health information and services to participate in decisions about their care. This new definition goes beyond simply ensuring that individuals understand health information: It focuses on the individual’s ability to use this information to make well-informed choices.
Low literacy refers to the inability to read, write, and comprehend basic information. It is a widespread issue; an estimated 21 percent of adults in the United States have low literacy levels (U.S. Department of Education, 2019). Individuals with low literacy have limited ability to access information, learn new skills, and fully participate in society. Low literacy is often linked to other socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, low education levels, and limited access to health care. It can negatively impact health outcomes because those with low literacy may struggle to understand health information, follow treatment plans, and manage their own health.
Effectively communicating with clients with low health literacy involves using plain, nonmedical language; speaking clearly and slowly; and being specific and concrete, avoiding vague or subjective terms such as “not well” and “a few.” Common words one would use to explain medical information to friends or family, such as “stomach” or “belly” instead of “abdomen,” are appropriate. Nurses should pay attention to the words clients use to describe their illness and then use those words in conversation. Showing a client how to do something, such as performing an exercise or taking medicine, may be clearer than verbal explanations.

Chapter Summary
Cultural and linguistic competence is the ability to understand and respond effectively to the culturally diverse needs that clients bring to health care encounters. Different communication styles affect how individuals interpret messages and may involve tone, volume, and speed of speech; eye contact; facial expressions; emotional expressiveness; and high- and low-context communication. Promoting health literacy—the ability to access, understand, and use health information or services to make informed decisions—can reduce health disparities.

Nurses play a crucial role in addressing low literacy by using effective communication strategies and providing clear, simple health information that is easy to understand. This may include using visual aids, plain language, and teach-back methods to ensure that clients with low literacy can comprehend and act on health information. By recognizing the impact of low literacy on health outcomes and implementing tailored communication strategies, nurses can help bridge the gap and improve health equity for all individuals, regardless of their literacy levels.","atie t health outcomes as s with low literacy may struggle to understand health information, o treatment plans, and mnate effectively with health c oves us pla cal le in arn low a bing efetive oucti trate and ron le pl eal information ta s as to nstad  ma ie us sua aids lin lne and teahacetho to ensure ta cle th l literay an compehend and ct o health inoaton. reconiin te act o l itera n alt oume and ileenting aloe communication tatierche bi te a and e health it or a indiia rede thirites.",36.070381231671554,"health with low literacy may struggle to understand health information, treatment plans, and with health literacy using and information is to and to that clients and of health and health",15.384615384615385," with low literacy may struggle to understand health information, ",4.615384615384616

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Discuss the impact of personal factors on culturally responsive care.
Describe systemic barriers to providing culturally responsive care.
Identify strategies to overcome barriers to providing culturally responsive care.

Personal Factors
Personal factors including value system, beliefs, customs, and cultural identity, as well as knowledge and attitudes about other cultures, play a role in nurses’ interactions with clients. Cultural factors such as language and communication barriers, gendered roles, and health care practices can impact these interactions. Nurses who have limited experience interacting with clients from different backgrounds may lack cultural humility. These nurses may exhibit biases, othering, stereotyping, and ethnocentrism in their approach to care.
A nurse’s age and educational preparation can also affect their provision of culturally responsive care. Younger generations are increasingly more diverse (Fry & Parker, 2018), and older individuals may be less familiar with changing cultural dynamics. Education can provide individuals with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking tools to effectively interact with a wide range of people. Individuals educated in a diverse environment who have some cross-cultural knowledge may be more adept at interacting with people outside their own culture (Sharifi et al., 2019). Socialization, personality, and prior experiences also play a role. For instance, people who were raised in diverse communities or who have traveled outside their own culture may feel more comfortable interacting with people from different cultures in a variety of settings, such as in the workplace, in social situations, and in their community.
Biases, Stereotyping, and Othering
Biases are prejudicial attitudes that filter the way people perceive, interpret, and react to the world. These opinions or beliefs (involving gender, race, age, or other categories) affect decision-making in ways that can be subtle or overt. When nurses focus only on certain information while ignoring other relevant data, their biases can lead to incorrect assumptions, judgments, and actions. In health care, biases can cause health care workers to draw false conclusions. They can lead to disparities in diagnoses and treatments, unequal access to services and resources, and slower response times. For example, due to bias, a nurse may view one group as lower priority and less deserving of care than other groups and, as a result, may not give clients from that group the same level of attention, fully explain procedures or medications, or advocate for them as strongly.
Bias can be both explicit and implicit. Explicit bias refers to clear and intentional feelings, attitudes, and behaviors; it exists at a conscious level and is often expressed verbally. When it reaches an extreme, explicit bias can manifest overtly as negative behaviors, such as physical or verbal harassment, or through more subtle forms such as exclusion. Implicit bias is a type of prejudice that unconsciously affects a person’s behavior, decisions, and attitudes, even if it contradicts their expressed beliefs and values. Because it operates at an unconscious level, the individual is not fully aware of their behaviors. Implicit bias undermines clinical assessments, the establishment of therapeutic relationships, and decision-making, all of which negatively affect health outcomes.
Bias among health care providers can have a substantial impact on an individual’s or group’s health. For example, evidence increasingly demonstrates that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ experience significant disparities in their physical and mental health because of implicit biases (Lick et al., 2013). In a 2020 study, 24 percent of LBGTQ people of color reported some form of negative or discriminatory behavior from a health care provider in the previous year, and 19 percent stated they were cared for by a physician who was visibly uncomfortable with their sexual orientation (Mahowald, 2021).
Implicit Bias
Implicit biases among nurses and other health professionals contribute to the persistence of health inequities. In this Institute for Healthcare Improvement video, Dr. Anurag Gupta discusses how different forms of implicit racial bias may negatively impact three areas of health care. Watch the video and respond to the following questions:
What are the three manifestations of implicit racial bias Dr. Gupta describes?
How does implicit racial bias affect the care some clients receive?
What are some strategies nurses can use to identify implicit racial bias?
To learn more about implicit bias, go to this free, evidence-based training on implicit bias from the National Institutes of Health (2023). You can take this training online or download the PDF version. The course includes three modules designed to help individuals recognize implicit bias and minimize its impact.
Stereotyping is the act of ascribing certain characteristics or behaviors to someone based on their membership, or perceived membership, in a particular group. Stereotyping can lead to assumptions about people based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, age, socioeconomic status, ability, or sexual orientation that may not be accurate or fair. In health care, stereotyping can have a negative impact if it leads to unequal, inadequate, or inappropriate care of clients. Stereotyping can also create a barrier to effective communication between nurses and their clients, negatively impacting the quality of care. For example, a nurse working with an older adult may assume, based on the client’s age, that they are not computer literate and therefore neglect to provide helpful online resources. Nurses must gather and use accurate information about their clients as individuals rather than relying on learned, and potentially damaging, assumptions.
Othering is the process of excluding, marginalizing, or differentiating individuals or groups based on their perceived differences from the dominant group in a society. Othering is used to separate individuals who do not fit social norms or expectations, and it often implies that a person or group is inferior. This can involve ascribing negative characteristics or traits, which can lead to feelings of isolation, discrimination, and social inequality. Othering can have harmful effects on individuals and communities because it can create barriers to social inclusion, equal opportunities, and fair treatment. It can also reinforce negative stereotypes and prejudices and prevent individuals and groups from being treated with dignity and respect. For example, a community health nurse is teaching a group of adults about the importance of smoking cessation. One of the clients who has been quiet throughout the session finally asks a question, speaking in a heavy accent. Rather than responding to the client the same way they answered questions from others in the group, the nurse speaks loudly and slowly, using very simplistic words and assuming that the client does not understand English. This behavior, while potentially meant to be helpful, can instead stigmatize, exclude, and isolate the client, ultimately having a negative impact on their health and well-being.
Ethnocentrism
Ethnocentrism, as previously mentioned, is the belief that one’s own culture is superior to other cultures (Beser et al., 2021). Ethnocentrism involves judging others by the standards of one’s own culture, assuming that one’s own culture is the norm against which all others should be measured. Ethnocentrism can result in discrimination, bias, and suboptimal care. For example, a client newly diagnosed with heart failure has been prescribed a diuretic. The nurse is reviewing the medication with the client and asks if they have any questions. The client, feeling apprehensive, expresses a wish to consult with a traditional healer from their cultural group. Rather than encouraging collaboration, the nurse perceives the traditional cultural practices as inferior to their own cultural orientation to biomedicine. Assuming that non-Western medicine is ineffective or irrational while Western biomedicine is superior is an example of ethnocentrism. Nurses need to be aware of their own ethnocentric tendencies, striving to be more culturally aware and culturally sensitive. Practicing cultural humility (see Attitudes, Skills, and Knowledge) allows nurses to recognize the biases created by ethnocentrism and to emphasize the client’s values, rather than those of the nurse or the dominant culture (Foronda et al., 2022).

Systemic Barriers to Providing Culturally Responsive Care
Some of the policies, practices, and procedures in U.S. health care present systemic barriers to providing culturally responsive nursing care. These systemic barriers may be organizational or structural. Organizational barriers are related to a particular clinic, hospital, or other health care institution, whereas structural barriers result from factors in the broader health care environment—for example, the composition of the health care workforce, the workings of the U.S. health insurance industry, and state and federal laws governing the provision of health care.
Organizational Barriers
Barriers to cultural competence may exist within organizations. These barriers can be far-reaching in scope because they extend well beyond the individual. Organizational barriers include lack of diversity in the workforce, lack of education in cultural competence, inadequate or absent translation or interpretive services, policies and procedures that fail to consider a diverse clientele, and lack of support from leadership. Leadership in particular plays a key role in creating a culture of inclusion and respect for diversity, as well as in designing, implementing, and enforcing policies to support an inclusive workplace and provide culturally and linguistically responsive services (Office of Minority Health, n.d.). For example, a lack of support from organizational leaders who do not prioritize or value cultural competence makes it more difficult for nurses to provide culturally responsive care. Furthermore, because culture is ever changing, providing culturally responsive care requires a commitment to updating and maintaining programs and policies that support it.
Structural Inequities
Structural inequities in health care are the systemic barriers and disparities in the health care system that prevent certain individuals or groups from receiving optimal care. These inequities can be caused by a range of factors, including unequal access to health care resources, discriminatory policies and practices, and inadequate representation of certain groups in the health care workforce. In the United States, lack of health insurance coverage and the cost of health care represent significant structural inequities that greatly affect health outcomes. Specifically, among rural adults, 24.5 percent of Black and 23.1 percent of Hispanic individuals report not seeing a physician because of the cost, compared with 15 percent of White individuals (James, 2017). Although Black, Hispanic, and Native American individuals bear a greater burden of chronic diseases than White individuals do, more of them lack a consistent source of medical care, health insurance coverage, and the ability to afford care (James, 2017).
Another example of structural inequity is the unequal distribution of health care resources, such as diagnostic and treatment facilities, across different communities. For example, individuals in rural areas or those living in communities of lower socioeconomic status may have limited access to specialized medical care. This lack of access can have a significant impact on population health because it can result in individuals’ not receiving the care they need, leading to an increase in preventable illnesses and chronic conditions.
A lack of representation of certain groups in the health care workforce is also a structural inequity. For instance, Black and Latina/Latino individuals are underrepresented in the health professions, including nursing, which can diminish efforts to provide culturally responsive care for clients from these backgrounds and reduce the quality of care provided. Evidence shows that the majority of Black (61.1 percent) and Hispanic (61.3 percent) adults prefer a health care provider who either shares or understands their culture. However, of those with this preference, 13.4 percent of Black and 14.7 percent of Hispanic individuals were never able to meet with such a provider, compared with 4 percent of White individuals (Terlizzi et al., 2019).

Chapter Summary
Personal factors that affect a nurse’s ability to provide culturally responsive care include value system, beliefs, customs, cultural identity, and knowledge and attitudes about other cultures. Implicit and explicit biases, stereotypes, othering, and ethnocentrism play a role in nurses’ interactions with clients. Barriers to providing culturally responsive nursing care include systemic and organizational barriers within the health care system and structural inequities in the broader health care environment.

Chapter Summary Personal factors that affect a nurse’s ability to provide culturally responsive care include value system, beliefs, customs, cultural identity, and knowledge and attitudes about other cultures. Implicit and explicit biases, stereotypes, othering, and ethnocentrism play a role in nurses’ interactions with clients. Barriers to providing culturally responsive nursing care include systemic and organizational barriers within the health care system and structural inequities in the broader health care environment.","provider (Smedley et al., 2003). This lack of representation can lead to a lack of trust in the health care system and result in disparities in health outcomes. Overcoming Barriers to Providing Culturally Responsive Care Overcoming barriers to providing culturally responsive care requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both organizational and structural challenges. Strategies to overcome these barriers include promoting diversity in the health care workforce, providing ongoing education and training in cultural competence, implementing policies and procedures that support cultural responsiveness, and advocating for changes in health care systems and policies to address structural inequities. Promoting Diversity in the Health Care Workforce Increasing diversity in the health care workforce is essential for providing culturally responsive care. A diverse workforce can better understand and address the needs of a diverse clientele, leading to improved health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Efforts to promote diversity in the health care workforce include recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, providing support and mentorship for these individuals, and creating inclusive work environments that value and celebrate diversity. Ongoing Education and Training in Cultural Competence Ongoing education and training in cultural competence are crucial for nurses and other health care professionals to provide effective care to diverse populations. This education should focus on developing cultural awareness, knowledge, and skills, as well as addressing implicit biases and stereotypes. Training should also include instruction on effective communication with clients from diverse backgrounds, the provision of language services, and the incorporation of cultural beliefs and practices into care plans. Policies and Procedures that Support Cultural Responsiveness Implementing policies and procedures that support cultural responsiveness is essential for creating an inclusive and respectful health care environment. This includes providing access to translation and interpretive services, incorporating cultural competence into organizational standards and performance evaluations, and ensuring that leadership actively promotes and supports cultural responsiveness. Advocating for Changes in Health Care Systems and Policies to Address Structural Inequities Advocating for changes in health care systems and policies is necessary to address structural inequities that contribute to disparities in health care. This may involve advocating for increased access to health insurance coverage, addressing discriminatory practices, and promoting the equitable distribution of health care resources across communities. Nurses can play a crucial role in advocating for policy changes at the local, state, and national levels to address these systemic barriers and improve health outcomes for all individuals and communities. In conclusion, addressing systemic barriers to providing culturally responsive care requires a comprehensive and collaborative effort that involves nurses, health care organizations, policymakers, and communities. By promoting diversity, providing education and training, implementing supportive policies and procedures, and advocating for systemic changes, nurses can contribute to creating a health care system that is inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all individuals.","provider med th  erent of t in e et a  aniatinal es Barriers to ultural ene a eist iin ra ese arrers a e arach  ase th tnl nd tual anatio barriers include o diversity in the workforce,  o education in cultural competence, ieentin policies and procedures that sr cltal sposieess an cating fo anes iet ae ssem and policies to adde utural inuitiesoniversi int Health ae orfornain derst ite ealt ae orfor sesto provid culturally responsive care. rerore ca te erand a ress e ees a cient aing t proams and piet stit. rts trt ieit in health care re ic rer and rtiin al rm preenterai nd  groups roving pt ae hese iniis and reat incluie es that ae ere dirity oici and rain inutrpeenation  taing in tal coetene ae cal r re and the health care pressinals t re ffecteat outos. i aon uldus  eeo la aren o andils   seing pici bases ad tereote ini shoula incde instrun of conicatn it ins ro e ackonste so of lanuae ere, and the icrora of ctural eie adrtiet care as oic and reatt ltesosien mmnti ple nddus  rural resosivn i nti for ceat a iie a specl eal care.

Attitudes, Beliefs, and Values
The American Association of Colleges of Nursing definition of cultural competence is, above all, a call to action: It sets nurses the task of building the attitudes, skills, and knowledge necessary to provide quality care. What are these attitudes, skills, and knowledge?
An open, nonjudgmental attitude is essential to providing culturally responsive care. A culturally responsive nurse displays the following:
An interest in learning about other beliefs and practices
A willingness to engage in dialogue that encourages learning and mutual respect
The motivation to challenge assumptions and biases
A commitment to equity and inclusion
The desire to help create a safe space for everyone
Among the many skills required to provide culturally responsive care, a few key skills should be part of every nurse’s tool kit. Critical thinking is needed to identify and analyze policies, structures, and practices that are oppressive or that disadvantage certain individuals or groups. Linguistic competence is necessary for communicating effectively with people from different backgrounds and for listening empathetically and openly (see Linguistically Responsive Care). The ability to adapt to new cultural environments and navigate unfamiliar situations is essential. Culturally responsive attitudes also include approaching diversity positively, valuing and respecting cultural differences, practicing cultural humility, and not discriminating against individuals on the basis of culture. These attitudes support cultural awareness, one of the skills most critical to providing culturally responsive care.
Valuing and Respecting Diversity
Valuing diversity means recognizing that everyone is unique and that diversity is a valuable aspect of society. It involves treating all individuals with respect and without discrimination and being open to learning from, and collaborating with, people from diverse backgrounds. Valuing diversity can foster a more inclusive and welcoming environment, and it can lead to better outcomes for both individuals and organizations.
What does valuing and respecting diversity look like? It begins with recognizing the unique backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of clients and colleagues, including varied cultural health beliefs and practices. For example, a nurse serving a community that has experienced a recent influx of immigrants could follow local news stories about the new immigrant population and read books and articles about the immigrant group’s culture to develop a baseline knowledge that would become richer and more informed with each client interaction.
Nurses can engage with people from different backgrounds and cultures, both at work and socially, to get to know them and better understand their perspectives. An open mind is critical, as are effective communication and a willingness to learn from others. Nurses should advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace and recognize any personal biases or stereotypes that may impact their interactions with others. Self-awareness is key to both understanding one’s own perspective and challenging it. By taking these steps, nurses can show their commitment to valuing and respecting diversity, thereby fostering a more inclusive and nurturing environment for their clients, colleagues, communities, and organizations.
Developing Self-Awareness
To value and respect diversity, nurses must recognize and understand their personal biases, values, and beliefs; the ways those are influenced by their own cultural backgrounds; and the ways they influence their own perceptions and behaviors. To achieve that recognition and understanding, nurses must seek self-awareness (Foronda et al., 2018). This self-awareness can enable a nurse to identify the role their own biases, values, and beliefs play in their interactions with clients, nurse colleagues, and other health care professionals. Each nurse needs to examine their own life experiences, family background, cultural traditions, religious beliefs, health practices, and personal preferences. Because values change over time, it is helpful for nurses to consider how their biases, values, and beliefs have developed and to reflect on how they may be continuing to evolve. Nurses need to examine their own biases to ensure they are not perpetuating any stereotypes or prejudices, and they need to reflect on their own values and beliefs to identify how they may help or hinder their ability to provide culturally responsive care.
To develop self-awareness and identify hidden biases, nurses can start by reflecting on their experiences, cultural background, and stereotypes and how these may impact their ability to objectively evaluate and care for others. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a psychological tool designed to measure bias and the impact that unconscious attitudes and beliefs have on day-to-day decision-making, can help nurses identify their hidden biases (Project Implicit, 2011). Nurses can challenge their biases by engaging in open and respectful conversations with people from different backgrounds, asking questions to learn more about the experiences and perspectives of others.
Participating in activities that embrace and promote diversity can also help nurses develop self-awareness and cultural understanding. Such activities include attending cultural events, volunteering at health clinics that serve immigrant communities, and attending interfaith services. By engaging in these activities, nurses can continue to learn and grow in their understanding of individuals and groups from diverse cultural backgrounds, building the skills and knowledge necessary to provide compassionate, culturally congruent care to their clients. Managing the Dynamics of Difference describes strategies for developing cultural awareness in more detail.
The Central Vancouver Island Multicultural Society (2021) has developed a cultural competence self-awareness checklist that individuals can use to check their progress toward developing cultural competence.

Applying Models of Cultural Competence
Transcultural Nursing introduced several frameworks for providing effective, culturally appropriate nursing care that produces positive, equitable outcomes. These models can serve as tools for considering how best to provide culturally responsive care.
Campinha-Bacote’s Process of Cultural Competence Model
Campinha-Bacote’s process of cultural competence model emphasizes that cultural competence is not a fixed attribute or trait, but rather a process that health care professionals engage in to provide high-quality, effective care to clients from diverse cultural backgrounds (Campinha-Bacote, 2002). This process has five components: cultural awareness, cultural skill, cultural knowledge, cultural encounters, and cultural desire.
Cultural awareness involves examining and exploring one’s own cultural background, beliefs, and biases and consciously avoiding them when interacting with clients from other cultures.
Cultural skill is the ability to collect cultural data, perform culturally sensitive assessments, and consider biological and physiologic variations.
Cultural knowledge serves as a foundation for understanding the diversity of cultural groups.
Cultural encounters are interactions with clients from different cultural backgrounds.
Cultural desire is the motivation to engage in the process of becoming culturally competent and to provide culturally responsive care.
Recently, Campinha-Bacote refined her model to include cultural competemility, the combination of cultural competence and cultural humility in the delivery of health care services (Campinha-Bacote, 2018), to encourage health care professionals to be culturally humble throughout the process of cultural competence.
Because Campinha-Bacote’s model specifically examines the process of cultural competence, it is easy to use in clinical situations. For example, a nurse who is motivated to engage in the process of cultural competence expresses a desire to provide culturally responsive care for a client from a religious background that observes dietary restrictions. Through cultural awareness, the nurse recognizes that the client’s beliefs and traditions may impact which foods they can eat. Therefore, the nurse clarifies these preferences during their assessment and continues to use cultural assessment skills to seek knowledge about the client’s dietary practices.
The Giger and Davidhizar Transcultural Assessment Model
Giger and Davidhizar’s transcultural assessment model (Giger & Haddad, 2020) is used to evaluate a client’s cultural values and perspectives of health and disease behaviors. According to this model, every individual is culturally unique and should be assessed according to six phenomena: communication, space, social organization, time orientation, environmental control, and biological variations.
Communication, both verbal and nonverbal, transmits cultural norms and expectations, thereby conveying meaning and forming identity.
Space refers to the distance between individuals when they interact; different cultural groups have different behaviors concerning personal distance and physical interaction.
Social organization refers to how a cultural group is organized and includes factors such as family structure, religious values, and role assignments.
Time orientation, which is the perspective and value placed on the past, present, or future, can vary based on culture.
Environmental control refers to the belief in one’s ability to control and plan for factors in the environment.
Biological variations are differences between individuals in developmental patterns, disease prevalence, and genetic variations.
Nurses may use Giger and Davidhizar’s transcultural model to evaluate how different individuals and groups perceive and approach illness to develop tailored plans of care. For example, some cultures place a greater emphasis on the present and less value on planning for the future. This can affect the way group members approach health care, such as their willingness to adhere to long-term treatment plans or to obtain preventive care. On the other hand, cultures that have a more future-oriented perspective place greater emphasis on planning and preparing for the future, including taking steps to prevent illness and maintain good health.
Another example of this model’s application is to consider how, in some cultures, illness may be viewed as a natural part of life, with more emphasis on the social and spiritual aspects of disease than on physiologic or biological manifestations. Individuals from these cultural backgrounds may prefer to seek care from traditional healers or practitioners instead of, or in addition to, Western medical care. In contrast, Western culture emphasizes biomedical explanations for illness and tends to prioritize evidence-based interventions. When differences arise, it is critical for the nurse to remain nonjudgmental and respectful of the client’s preferences. For example, if a client expresses a desire to receive acupuncture, the nurse should work with the client and healer to develop a culturally congruent care plan (). This care plan should be communicated to all members of the care team and tailored to the individual’s needs.
Some clients may seek care from traditional healers or other practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine. A nurse would incorporate these practices into a culturally congruent care plan. (credit: “Curandera – Traditional Healers” by Larry Lamsa/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Joseph, a 25-year-old Black transgender man, arrives at the community clinic seeking information about the services provided. Joseph explains that, despite his gender identity, his legal documents still reflect his assigned female name, Jada. Last month, Joseph began hormone therapy to increase his masculine features and is considering gender-affirming surgery that will include breast reduction and a hysterectomy. During his visit, he appears nervous and jittery and avoids making eye contact. Joseph explains that he recently had unprotected sex and is concerned about his HIV status.
How should a nurse begin their encounter with Joseph?
How might personal factors affect a nurse’s interaction with Joseph?
Identify other factors that can impact Joseph’s experience and care.
Using Giger and Davidhizar’s transcultural assessment model, how would you provide culturally responsive care to Joseph during his first visit to the clinic?
Alternatively, how would the use of Purnell’s model inform the care provided to Joseph?
(See White et al., 2020.)
The Purnell Model for Cultural Competence
The Purnell model for cultural competence (Purnell, 2019) promotes cultural awareness and appreciation in the context of health care. Consisting of 12 domains of cultural knowledge, the model covers a wide range of concepts and skills related to cultural competence. Each domain includes a range of topics related to cultural differences and their impact on health care. For example, the death rituals domain identifies a client’s beliefs and practices related to death, dying, and bereavement. Pregnancy and childbearing practices vary widely around the world; this domain covers cultural beliefs and practices related to fertility, birth control, pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. See Transcultural Nursing for more about the Purnell model.
Nurses can implement Purnell’s model throughout the nursing process, using their clinical judgment and collaborating with the client to select and emphasize the components that are most relevant to the individual client’s care (Purnell & Fenkl, 2021). For instance, using Purnell’s model, a nurse caring for a Native American client who follows traditional spiritual practices would elicit the client’s views and preferences about incorporating care from a tribal healer, and then work to facilitate that collaboration if the client desires.

In what ways can you use the Campinha-Bacote process of cultural competence model to improve health care encounters for all individuals?

Tools for Measuring Cultural Competence
Although the importance of cultural competence is well recognized in nursing, developing accurate and reliable assessment tools to measure it has been challenging. Measurement tools provide nurses with a way to assess their own development of cultural competence and confidence when caring for clients from different backgrounds. A recent review of tools to measure cultural competence found that only a limited number have been tested (Yadollahi et al., 2020), two of which are presented here. These tools provide nurses and nursing students a means for self-assessment of their development of cultural competence and self-efficacy in providing culturally responsive care.
The Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among Healthcare Professionals (IAPCC-R) is used to assess the cultural competence of health care professionals according to the five constructs of Campinha-Bacote’s model (Camphina-Bacote, 2002). The IAPCC-R consists of 25 items evaluated using a four-point scale. Scores on the IAPCC-R range from 25 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher level of cultural competence. The inventory has been widely used in health care research and has been translated into multiple languages, including Swedish, Hebrew, German, Spanish, Korean, Finnish, French, and Japanese. However, one criticism of the tool is that the reading level is very advanced, potentially making it more difficult to use than others.
The Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool (TSET) is a scale designed to measure the confidence of nurses and nursing students in providing transcultural nursing care (Jeffreys & Dogan, 2010). It consists of 83 items in three categories: cognitive, practical, and affective. The cognitive subscale assesses self-efficacy, or confidence, regarding knowledge about caring for clients from different cultural backgrounds; the practical subscale evaluates self-efficacy in cross-cultural interactions; and the affective subscale assesses self-efficacy regarding cultural awareness, acceptance, and respect for other cultures. The TSET is answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not confident) to 10 (fully confident).

Chapter Summary
Culturally responsive attitudes include a positive approach to diversity, respect and equal treatment for cultural differences, and cultural humility. Models of cultural competence offer ways to best provide culturally responsive care and include Campinha-Bacote’s process of cultural competence, Giger and Davidhizar’s transcultural model, and the Purnell model of cultural competence. Tools for self-assessment of cultural competence include the IAPCC-R and the TSET.

A recent review of tools to measure cultural competence found that only a limited number have been tested (Yadollahi et al., 2020), two of which are presented here. These tools provide nurses and nursing students a means for self-assessment of their development of cultural competence and self-efficacy in providing culturally responsive care. The Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence Among Healthcare Professionals (IAPCC-R) is used to assess the cultural competence of health care professionals according to the five constructs of Campinha-Bacote’s model (Camphina-Bacote, 2002). The IAPCC-R consists of 25 items evaluated using a four-point scale. Scores on the IAPCC-R range from 25 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher level of cultural competence. The inventory has been widely used in health care research and has been translated into multiple languages, including Swedish, Hebrew, German, Spanish, Korean, Finnish, French, and Japanese. However, one criticism of the tool is that the reading level is very advanced, potentially making it more difficult to use than others. The Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool (TSET) is a scale designed to measure the confidence of nurses and nursing students in providing transcultural nursing care (Jeffreys & Dogan, 2010). It consists of 83 items in three categories: cognitive, practical, and affective. The cognitive subscale assesses self-efficacy, or confidence, regarding knowledge about caring for clients from different cultural backgrounds; the practical subscale evaluates self-efficacy in cross-cultural interactions; and the affective subscale assesses self-efficacy regarding cultural awareness, acceptance, and respect for other cultures. The TSET is answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not confident) to 10 (fully confident). Chapter Summary Culturally responsive attitudes include a positive approach to diversity, respect and equal treatment for cultural differences, and cultural humility. Models of cultural competence offer ways to best provide culturally responsive care and include Campinha-Bacote’s process of cultural competence, Giger and Davidhizar’s transcultural model, and the Purnell model of cultural competence. Tools for self-assessment of cultural competence include the IAPCC-R and the TSET.","he recently had unprotected sex and is concerned about his HIV status.

The Purnell Model for Cultural Competence The Purnell model for cultural competence (Purnell, 2019) promotes cultural awareness and appreciation in the context of health care. Consisting of 12 domains of cultural knowledge, the model covers a wide range of concepts and skills related to cultural competence. Each domain includes a range of topics related to cultural differences and their impact on health care. For example, the death rituals domain identifies a client’s beliefs and practices related to death, dying, and bereavement. Pregnancy and childbearing practices vary widely around the world; this domain covers cultural beliefs and practices related to fertility, birth control, pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. See Transcultural Nursing for more about the Purnell model. Nurses can implement Purnell’s model throughout the nursing process, using their clinical judgment and collaborating with the client to select and emphasize the components that are most relevant to the individual client’s care (Purnell & Fenkl, 2021). For instance, using Purnell’s model, a nurse caring for a Native American client who follows traditional spiritual practices would elicit the client’s views and preferences about incorporating care from a tribal healer, and then work to facilitate that collaboration if the client desires.

This process has five components: cultural awareness, cultural skill, cultural knowledge, cultural encounters, and cultural desire.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Identify strategies to use when communicating through an interpreter.
Apply principles of culturally responsive care to clients and populations from diverse cultures.
Evaluate translated materials for accuracy and effectiveness.

Working With Translated Materials and Interpreters
Translation and interpretation are two different processes used to exchange information from one language to another. For both, a thorough knowledge of cultural and linguistic differences is necessary to effectively communicate meaning. Translation involves written communication, in which written text in one language is converted into written text in another language. Interpretation, on the other hand, involves oral communication, in which the words spoken in one language are rendered into another language in real time. Because of the difficulties presented by the live setting, interpretation can be more challenging than translation, such as when the speakers use the wrong words, correct themselves, or use local dialects. Furthermore, unlike the translation process, interpreters lack the ability to review the text or go back and listen again. These disadvantages can make it more difficult for interpreters to accurately convey the meaning of the message.
In any clinical setting, it is critical to use certified medical interpreters, professionals trained in the use of medical terminology, cultural awareness, and ethical conduct. The interpreter should be treated as a respected professional, and extra time should be allotted for messages to be conveyed and understood (). The environment should be free of distractions, and the interpreter should be provided with a summary of the client’s background, goals, and needs for the session. The name of the interpreter should be clearly documented.
A medical interpreter communicates information from a nurse to a client at a health clinic in Uganda. (credit: “MEDCAP – Natural Fire 10 – Palabek Kal Health Clinic – U.S. Army Africa – AFRICOM – 091018-F-8314S-137,” by U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Africa/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
When working with a client who needs an interpreter, the nurse should speak directly to the client rather than addressing the interpreter, even if the client makes eye contact with the interpreter. The nurse should observe and monitor nonverbal communication. Sentence-by-sentence interpretation and clear, simple language without medical jargon will ensure that the nurse and interpreter convey all important information to the client. The interpreter may ask open-ended questions to establish rapport or clarify client statements; during these times, the nurse should avoid interrupting the interpreter. Finally, near the end of a visit, the nurse should use the “teach-back” method to confirm that the client understands the directions and recommendations.
As a student or professional nurse, you may find yourself in a situation where a certified medical interpreter is not present. In these situations, it is critical to follow organizational policy and consult with leadership to locate or access remote interpretation services. Family members or friends should never be used as interpreters under any circumstances. The reasons for this are many, including a potential lack of accuracy, violation of privacy, potential conflicts of interest, and ethical and legal concerns. Think back to Cory’s interaction with Faiza. How should he have responded when the man accompanying Faiza offered to translate for her? What if the man accompanying Faiza is not actually her husband, but a trafficker who has been forcing Faiza into providing commercial sex?

Developing Culturally Tailored Materials
Nurse scientists have made significant contributions to the development and implementation of culturally tailored materials and interventions to address the specific needs of different cultural groups and to improve their engagement and outcomes. According to nurse researcher Miyong Kim, adapting materials and interventions to respond to a client’s or population’s cultural needs should consider eight domains: 1) audience, 2) language, 3) contents, 4) context, 5) concepts, 6) metaphors, 7) methods, and 8) goals (Kim et al., 2022). For example, culturally tailored materials use language, content, and ideas that reflect the values and traditions of the targeted cultural group; align with belief systems; and frame outcomes within the customs and traditions of the targeted group.
When a professional nurse designs a culturally tailored intervention, they first identify the cultural group on which the intervention will focus. This may be a specific ethnic or racial group, a religious group, a linguistic group, or any other group that has unique customs, experiences, or perspectives. So that the intervention is appropriate, acceptable, and effective, research is needed to understand the beliefs, values, and practices related to the issue being addressed (Im & Chee, 2021). This research may involve adapting an existing intervention or creating new ones, using culturally appropriate materials such as visuals, activities, and language that are respectful of the culture. Members of the targeted cultural group are often involved to ensure that the intervention is tailored to their needs (Kim et al., 2022). Involving multiple community members in the review process can help create buy-in and awareness.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has developed a strategy to create culturally tailored interventions using the mnemonic CAPABLE, in which each letter represents a consideration related to the best ways to meet a community’s needs when developing educational materials (Kelly et al., 2007):
Colors: Do the colors used have special significance for the target population?
Art: Are the images appropriate for and reflective of the target population?
Paper: If the materials are printed, is the paper easy to handle and read, and is its size appropriate for the target population?
Access: Will the materials be placed in physically accessible locations? Should the information be provided electronically?
Buy-in: Were members of the target population involved in developing or reviewing the materials? If so, do they endorse them?
Language: Are the words in a type size most people will be able to read? Is the content easy to comprehend, appropriate for the community being served, and written at a level most readers will understand?
Evaluation: What changes are needed to meet the needs of the target population?
After the intervention, the nurse should survey community members for feedback or observe health behaviors and outcomes to evaluate the impact of any changes made as a result of the materials. The findings would then be used to inform any revisions or additions to the materials.
Cultural Adaptation of Materials
This video from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) discusses best practices for making materials more culturally relevant for clients.
Watch the video, and then respond to the following questions:
Why is it necessary to develop culturally adapted materials and make them available for clients?
What are some potential barriers or challenges nurses and other health care professionals may face when developing culturally adapted materials for clients? How can these be overcome?
In what ways can culturally adapted materials enhance client engagement, health literacy, and adherence to treatment plans?

Chapter Summary
Strategies to provide clients with culturally and linguistically competent care include translation, interpretation via certified medical interpreters, observation of nonverbal communication, use of jargon-free language, the “teach-back” method, and culturally tailored materials. Such strategies address the specific content, language, and delivery needs of different clients and can improve their engagement and outcomes.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Define homeostasis.
Compare and contrast intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid and their effects on the body’s cells.
Discuss the major cations and anions and their essential functions.
Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a stable and constant internal environment despite changes in the external environment (Billman, 2020). This means that the body can regulate and balance its various physiologic processes, such as body temperature (see ), fluid balance, pH levels, blood sugar levels, and hormone levels, to ensure they remain within a narrow range that is optimal for the body’s functioning.
The human body is maintained by complex mechanisms that keep it in balance to promote physiologic function. (credit: modification of work from Biology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Homeostasis
Homeostasis is a fundamental process that enables the body to maintain a stable internal environment in the face of constantly changing internal and external conditions. Disruption of homeostatic mechanisms may cause diseases and severe impacts on physiologic well-being. Two key principles govern homeostasis: fluid balance and electrolyte balance.
The first principle of fluid balance involves maintaining the body’s fluid compartments in osmotic equilibrium, except for transient change. This means that the concentration of solutes in each compartment is carefully regulated to prevent water from flowing into or out of cells, which could disrupt cellular function (Koeppen & Stanton, 2023; Valls & Esposito, 2022).
The second principle of electrolyte balance involves ensuring that the numbers of ions (anions or cations) within each compartment of the body are balanced and electrically neutral. Each compartment works to maintain a constant volume of fluid and to replace and exchange ions to maintain this neutrality (Koeppen & Stanton, 2023; Valls & Esposito, 2022). This helps ensure that the body’s pH remains within a narrow range, which is essential for proper physiologic functioning.
Homeostasis in Children, Pregnant Clients, and Older Adults
Children have unique physiologic characteristics and developmental needs. Children have a relatively higher water requirement compared with adults because of their higher metabolic rate and larger proportion of body water. Children are also more likely than older individuals to become dehydrated because their kidneys are less efficient at conserving water. Electrolyte balance in children may be more susceptible to imbalances because of their immature kidneys, resulting in higher renal losses of sodium and potassium.
Pregnancy brings about significant physiologic changes that impact homeostatic mechanisms. Pregnancy increases blood volume and fluid retention to support the developing fetus. Hormonal changes influence fluid balance, causing the client to be more susceptible to edema and electrolyte imbalances. Increased levels of progesterone can also affect electrolyte regulation. Changes in kidney function and the demands of the developing fetus may impact the delicate balance of sodium, potassium, and calcium.
As individuals age, various physiologic changes occur.  Older adults often have a reduced sense of thirst and may not drink enough fluids, leading to an increased risk for dehydration. Age-related changes in the kidneys can also affect water and electrolyte regulation, resulting in a higher risk for imbalances such as hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (elevated potassium).
Homeostasis is a complex mechanism that requires an integrated control system for self-regulation. It is primarily governed by a feedback loop that involves three key components: the receptor, the control center, and the effector ().
The receptor is a sensory organ that detects changes in the internal or external environment of the body. It sends signals to the control center when it detects a change that needs to be corrected.
The control center is typically located in the brain or other part of the nervous system. It receives the signals from the receptor and processes them to determine the appropriate response. The control center then signals the effector.
The effector is the part of the body that carries out the response. It could be a muscle, gland, or organ that alters its activity to counteract the initial change detected by the receptor.
Feedback loops involve a receptor to a stimulus, the control center, and the effector that carries out the control center’s response. (credit: reproduced with permission of Tina D. Barbour-Taylor)
The feedback loop plays a critical role in maintaining a balanced internal environment in the face of changing internal and external conditions (Hannezo & Heisenberg, 2019; Molnar & Gair, n.d.). By detecting and correcting deviations from the set point, the body is able to ensure that its various physiologic processes are functioning optimally, thereby promoting overall health and well-being.

Cellular Compartments
60% of the total body weight is composed of water. The body separates this water in to two main fluid compartments: one that contains intracellular fluid and one that contains extracellular fluid. The fluid compartments work together to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance within the body. The movement of water and electrolytes between the compartments is regulated by various mechanisms, such as osmosis and active transport (Libretti & Puckett, 2022; Molnar & Gair, n.d).
The body strives to maintain a balance between the fluids in the compartment to ensure that the cells are surrounded by an environment that allows them to function optimally, as can be observed in . The concentration of ions, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, is carefully regulated in each compartment to maintain the proper osmotic pressure, which is the pressure needed to prevent water from flowing into or out of cells.
Disruptions in the fluid compartments, such as excessive fluid loss or retention, can lead to various health problems, including dehydration or edema.By regulating the equilibrium of body fluids, the body can guarantee the optimal operation of its diverse physiologic functions, thereby enhancing overall health and well-being.
The cell membrane is a semipermeable membrane that allows for the homeostasis of intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Intracellular Fluid
Intracellular fluid, also known as cytoplasm, refers to the fluid contained within the cells of the body. As shown in , intracellular fluid accounts for approximately 40% of the total body fluid in adults, and it plays a critical role in many physiologic processes.
The composition of intracellular fluid is tightly regulated to ensure that it provides an optimal environment for cellular function. It contains various electrolytes, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate ions, as well as proteins and other molecules essential for cell function.
Extracellular Fluid
Extracellular fluid is the fluid that surrounds the cells of the body, including fluid in the blood vessels and the fluid in the spaces between tissues and organs. It accounts for approximately 20% of the total body fluid in adults.
Extracellular fluid contains various electrolytes, such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, as well as proteins, hormones, and other molecules.
The extracellular fluid is divided into three subcompartments. The interstitial compartment, which surrounds the tissue cells, makes up approximately 15% of fluid volume; the intravascular compartment, which contains the plasma and blood, makes up approximately 5% of fluid volume; and the transcellular compartment makes up approximately 1% of fluid but is generally not included in fluid volume calculations.
Transcellular Compartment (Third Space)
The transcellular compartment, also known as the third space, refers to a small volume of fluid that is contained within certain body cavities and structures, such as the pleural cavity, peritoneal cavity, and joint spaces. This compartment is separate from the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments and is characterized by its limited communication with the rest of the body. The volume of fluid in the transcellular compartment is regulated by various mechanisms, including pressure and transport mechanisms, which ensure that it is in balance with the other fluid compartments.  lists fluid compartments and their volumes and major electrolytes for an adult.

Osmolality describes the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is defined as the number of solute particles per 1 kg of solvent, also known as an osmole,or a unit of osmotic concentration. Osmolarity refers to the number of solutes per 1 liter of solvent and provides valuable insight into how solutions will behave under different conditions, enabling the manipulation of their properties to achieve optimal changes within the body.

Osmolality
Osmolality is a measure of the concentration of solutes, such as sodium, glucose, and urea, in a solution; specifically, it refers to the number of particles per kilogram of solvent. It is commonly used to assess the osmotic pressure of body fluids, such as blood or urine, and can provide important information about the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance.
Hyperosmolality refers to a condition in which the concentration of solutes in a solution, such as blood or urine, is higher than normal. This can be caused by various factors, such as dehydration, diabetes, and certain drugs. Hyperosmolality may have serious consequences, such as impairment of the cardiovascular and circulatory system, as well as neurologic signs and symptoms such as irritability, seizures, and, in severe cases, coma.
Hypoosmolality refers to a state in which the concentration of solutes in a solution is lower than normal. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including excessive water intake, certain drugs, disorders affecting the kidneys, and hormonal dysregulation of water balance. Hypoosmolality can have serious consequences, including neurologic signs and symptoms and even coma if not corrected.
Iso-osmolality occurs when the concentration of solute particles per unit of volume in a solution is equal to a standard reference value.

Tonicity
Although osmolality and tonicity are related, they are not the same. Tonicity refers to the ability of a solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water and is relative to the cytoplasm of a cell (Khan & Farhana, 2023; Maldonado & Mohiuddin, 2022). A change in tonicity can have significant effects on cell function and overall fluid and electrolyte balance within the body.
Hypertonicity occurs when the tonicity of a solution is greater than that of the cytoplasm of a cell. This state can cause water to move out of the cell, potentially leading to cell shrinkage and changes in cell function. Hypertonicity can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration and increased solute concentration in a solution, such as with high glucose levels in the blood.
Hypotonicity is related to hypoosmolality. It is a state in which the tonicity of a solution is less than that of the cytoplasm of a cell. Water can then move into the cell, potentially leading to swelling and other changes in cell function. Hypotonicity can be caused by a variety of factors, including excessive water intake and certain medical conditions.
Isotonicity exists when the tonicity of a solution is equal to that of the cytoplasm of a cell. This means the concentration of solutes in the solution is balanced with the concentration of solutes inside the cell, resulting in no net movement of water into or out of the cell.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Describe how the body maintains homeostasis.
List factors that affect the body’s homeostasis.
Discuss osmotic equilibrium and transient changes.
Most medical conditions can be attributed to a breakdown in the homeostatic control system, whether it is due to an inability to detect external changes, failure to initiate a feedback loop, inability to respond to or return to the set point, or failure in the set point itself. The primary objective of health care providers is to restore the body’s homeostasis to prevent cellular death and irreversible organ damage.

Maintaining Homeostasis
The human body maintains a state of internal balance, called homeostasis, which is regulated at the cellular level. Even when the external environment fluctuates, the body strives to keep this balance within a narrow range. However, a temporary transient change can occur before the body returns to a steady state. Changes in the extracellular or intracellular fluid compartments can occur due to internal or external factors and are crucial for maintaining a narrow range to prevent cell death, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction (Libretti & Puckett, 2022).

Factors Impacting Homeostasis
Disturbances in physiologic factors can have a significant impact on the body’s ability to maintain homeostasis. Such disturbances include the following:
Disruptions in energy and nutrient balance, such as those that cause fluctuations in glucose levels
Dysregulation of immune response modulators, such as pH and cortisol
Disturbances in fluid and electrolyte levels, particularly sodium, potassium, and calcium
These components play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and are governed by a complex homeostatic mechanism called a feedback loop, which is discussed in more depth in a later section of this chapter.

Osmotic Equilibrium
Osmotic equilibrium occurs when the concentration of solutes on either side of a semipermeable membrane is equalized. It is achieved when the osmotic pressure of a solution is equal to the hydrostatic pressure on the solution. The force that causes the reabsorption of fluid from the interstitial fluid into the capillaries is known as osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. Unlike hydrostatic pressure, which pushes fluid out of the capillaries, osmotic pressure pulls fluid back into them. This balance ensures that the optimal concentrations of electrolytes and nonelectrolytes are maintained in cells, body tissues, and interstitial fluid. Transient changes in the body, such as changes in temperature or pH, can disrupt the osmotic equilibrium, leading to a shift of water and solutes between intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments in an attempt to restore balance.
The Na+K+ATPase pump is an essential component in maintaining osmotic equilibrium (Pirahanchi et al., 2022). This pump moves sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, against their concentration gradients. This active transport process requires energy from adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP), an energy molecule (Hoorm et al., 2020).Osmotic equilibrium is essential for maintaining proper functioning of cells and body tissues.  illustrates the Na+K+ATPase pump and the method by which it allows for osmotic equilibrium.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Define negative feedback loops as they relate to homeostasis.
Describe homeostatic responses within the body.
Explain positive feedback.
Feedback loops provide a mechanism for the body to maintain homeostasis. Feedback loops include negative feedback,the homeostatic response system, and positive feedback.

Negative Feedback and Homeostasis
Negative feedback is critical in regulating the body’s homeostasis to promote optimal health and well-being. These inhibitory loops allow the body to self-regulate by counteracting any deviation from normal conditions. The process begins with an increase in output from a body system, leading to higher levels of specific proteins or hormones. This increase subsequently triggers the homeostatic response system to inhibit or reverse the production of those proteins or hormones, preventing their levels from rising further. The body thus reduces the number of these proteins or hormones, maintaining a balance within the normal physiologic limits (Chakravarty et al., 2023; Molnar & Gair, n.d.). An example of negative feedback within the body is depicted in .

Homeostatic Response System
The homeostatic response system is a biological structure that is in a constant state of flux because of external and internal factors that push the body’s systems away from equilibrium. The homeostatic response system is vital for maintaining a stable internal environment. When the body experiences a stimulus, such as an elevated body temperature, a neuron (nerve cell) within the brain acts as a receptor or sensor, relaying the message to the control center, which may be the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or nervous system. The control center then activates effectors, whose role is to counteract the stimulus, thereby restoring homeostasis (see [link]Figure 4.3[/link]) (Libretti & Puckett, 2023). In this way, the homeostatic response system enables the body to adjust to changing conditions and maintain stability.

Positive Feedback
In positive feedback, the body responds to a stimulus by amplifying or enhancing it, rather than inhibiting it. This mechanism leads to a continuous increase in the stimulus, also known as a runaway effect, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Positive feedback loops are commonly found in processes that require rapid and decisive responses, such as the following:
Blood clotting
When an injury occurs, platelets in the blood stick to the damaged area and release chemical signals that attract more platelets. This recruitment of platelets leads to the formation of a blood clot, which further activates more platelets and reinforces the clotting process.
Lactation
During lactation, the mechanical stimulation of nerve endings in the breast signals the posterior pituitary gland to release oxytocin, which stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells within the breast. As milk is released, the sucking action of the baby continues, and this further stimulates the nerve endings in the breast, creating a positive feedback loop.
Uterine contraction during childbirth
During childbirth, the pressure of the baby against the cervix and the  tissue of the pelvic floor causes contraction of the uterus which then results in the release of oxytocin, which stimulates stronger contractions. As contractions intensify, more oxytocin is released, resulting in positive feedback until the baby is delivered (Libretti & Puckett, 2023)
Nonetheless, when not properly regulated, positive feedback loops may give rise to instability and potentially adverse consequences.
Homeostasis: The Negative and Positive Feedback Loops
In this video, Dr. Mike Todorovic, senior lecturer of anatomy and physiology at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia, discusses the importance of homeostasis and explains the negative and positive feedback loops.

This chapter gave an overview of homeostasis, the body’s ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the internal and external environments. One important component of homeostasis is the regulation of osmolality, which refers to the balance of solutes and water in the body. Homeostatic equilibrium is maintained through negative feedback loops, which involve a stimulus, a control center, and an effector, and positive feedback loops, which amplify a signal and can lead to a runaway effect if uncontrolled. The body’s ability to maintain homeostasis is essential for proper functioning of cells and tissues.

Identify etiology and diagnostic studies related to hypertension and angina.

Hypertension
The cardiovascular system transports blood and oxygen throughout the body. Blood flows from a system of higher resistance to one of lower resistance—from arteries to capillaries to veins. Blood pressure (see ) represents the force that blood flow exerts on arterial walls.
The walls of the arteries are much thicker than those of the veins because of the higher pressure of the blood that flows through them. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The two elements that determine blood pressure are cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit of time, usually measured in liters per minute. The CO is determined by the heart rate (HR), the number of times the heart beats per minute, and stroke volume (SV)—the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat—and is represented by the following equation: CO=HR×SV.
Blood pressure is determined by examining both systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings. The systolic blood pressure reading represents the amount of pressure within the arteries when the heart contracts, whereas the diastolic blood pressure reading reflects the amount of pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. The diastolic blood pressure reading, which is the lower pressure within the arteries and vessels, determines the peripheral vascular resistance (also known as systemic vascular resistance) by measuring blood flow and the level of constriction or dilatation within the arteries and vessels. Blood pressure (BP) is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is expressed as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure (for instance, 125/90 mm Hg).
Hypertension occurs when an individual’s blood pressure is above normal limits for a sustained period of time. Hypertension can be either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. Primary hypertension is caused by unknown elements; however, some studies have implicated genetics and behavioral and environmental factors, including age, high salt intake, insulin resistance, obesity, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and stress (Aggarwal et al., 2023; Iqbal & Jamal, 2022). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.), approximately 116 million adults in the United States have hypertension.
Importantly, hypertension is not limited to adults; it can also affect children and adolescents. In the United States and other countries, primary hypertension affects up to 5% of individuals in this younger age group. Developing high blood pressure during childhood can have long-term consequences, potentially leading to hypertension in adulthood and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Certain modifiable risk factors can be addressed for this population to improve blood pressure levels, including obesity, physical activity, and nutrition. Health care providers should always assess blood pressure in the pediatric population to promote preventive measures within families and foster healthy lifestyle habits (American Heart Association, 2023).
Secondary hypertension results from other conditions involving the central nervous system, endocrine system, and renal system and is treated along with the underlying condition. Secondary hypertension may be cured if the treatment for the underlying condition is successful.
Hormones also impact blood pressure regulation. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and vasopressin are the main physiologic regulatory systems or pathways affecting blood pressure homeostasis. RAAS, as illustrated in , is a compensatory mechanism the body activates during hypotension (when blood pressure is low). Renin is released from the kidneys in response to low blood pressure. Renin interacts with angiotensinogen and converts it to angiotensin I. The angiotensin-converting enzyme in the pulmonary blood vessel endothelium is then triggered to produce angiotensin II, which constricts arterioles, increasing peripheral resistance and increasing blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal medulla to produce catecholamine, which yields aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain water and sodium, which leads to water retention and results in an increased blood volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Vasopressin is an antidiuretic hormone that regulates reabsorption of water by the kidneys; it is released by the pituitary gland in response to low blood volume. Vasopressin causes retention of body fluids, vasoconstriction, and increased blood pressure.

American Heart Association and Mayo Clinic
The American Heart Association provides an interactive library on the anatomy of blood pressure. The library includes images and topics to explore such as the anatomy of blood pressure, high blood pressure and the cardiovascular system, and a blood pressure test.
This video with Dr. Leslie Thomas, MD, a nephrologist at Mayo Clinic, discusses facts, questions, and answers about blood pressure to help clients better understand hypertension. The video talks about hypertension, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and coping methods to manage the disease process.
Grades of Hypertension
The American Heart Association (AHA) (n.d-a.) reports that prolonged elevation of blood pressure leads to the deterioration of blood vessels. The deterioration of blood vessels is measured by grades of hypertension. Normal blood pressure is a systolic reading of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading of less than 80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure and hypertension increase the risk of vascular damage and decrease oxygenation. The chart below from the American College of Cardiology and AHA (see ) demonstrates the blood pressure categories and the readings associated with them.

Diagnostics
A physical examination by a health care provider with a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff or device) will identify an elevated blood pressure, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can assist in determining if the heart has a normal or abnormal rhythm. The health care provider also obtains blood work to determine factors that contribute to the client’s hypertension as well as how the body is reacting to elevated blood pressure. These laboratory tests include a complete blood cell count (CBC), basic electrolyte panel, cholesterol panel, and renal function. An echocardiogram—an ultrasound of the heart—is not typically included in diagnostic procedures to determine hypertension; however, the health care provider may add this diagnostic study to visualize the heart’s chambers, valves, and pumping action to determine the effect of hypertension on the heart, which may cause other disorders such as hypertrophy of the heart. The health care provider bases the diagnosis for hypertension on the findings of the physical examination and the diagnostic study results.
Clinical Manifestations
Symptoms of hypertension may not occur for years, and most of the time, the symptoms can be silent. Symptoms typically associated with hypertension include elevated blood pressure readings, headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological disturbances such as disorientation or a decreased level of consciousness. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to organ damage. Clients can experience symptoms related to the specific organ that is damaged; for example, if hypertension is left untreated, it may cause renal insufficiency, which may then continue to deteriorate, causing kidney damage and leading to end-stage renal disease that requires dialysis.
Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Hypertension
Nonpharmacologic measures used to treat hypertension center around lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes focus on the client’s personal, social, and cultural influences. These changes may include diet modification, increased physical activity and exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption reduction, relaxation techniques, and self-monitoring.
The AHA conducted a critical assessment of research and clinical knowledge on cardiovascular disease across the United States specifically addressing women’s health. In its report to the president, gaps were identified and actions outlined to optimize cardiovascular health in women across their lifespans, with the goal of reaching health equity in health care (Wenger et al., 2022). The AHA has deployed awareness campaigns that are culturally sensitive and focus on the optimization of preventive and clinical care. Community engagement and advocacy in policy change at the legislative level have been encouraged.
In a fireside video chat, The Heart of the Matter: Racial and Gender Bias in Cardiovascular Care, presented by Abbott Cardiovascular, an expert panel of health care providers and representatives discusses cardiovascular care. The panel identifies gender and racial bias as negatively impacting the client experience for persons with coronary and peripheral artery disease. The chat covers not only cardiovascular health but also technologies that may be utilized to bridge the critical gaps identified.
Dietary Modification
Clients with hypertension should eat a low-sodium diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other recommendations include low-fat dairy products and limiting meat intake to about two servings daily of lean meat, such as fish and poultry (Challa & Ameer, 2023). Reducing sweets and red meat is also important. The AHA (n.d-b) recommends 1,500 mg to no more than 2,300 mg of sodium intake daily. Dietary patterns and nutritional therapy should focus on food preferences, social and cultural influences, and appropriate caloric intake.
Physical Activity and Exercise
The AHA (n.d-d.) recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity weekly. Average time for exercise should be at least 30–40 minutes per session to assist in decreasing blood pressure. If the client cannot do 30–40 minutes of moderate exercise four times a week, the nurse should suggest an alternate exercise plan, emphasizing that some physical activity is better than no physical activity. Physical activity and exercise enhance weight reduction and promote a healthy lifestyle.
Smoking Cessation and Reducing Alcohol Consumption
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of coronary artery disease. Smoking increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes vasoconstriction and, therefore, increases blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial contractility. Although smoking has been established as a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its relationship to high blood pressure is still being investigated. Nevertheless, smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke contribute to increased accumulation of fatty deposits within the arteries, which high blood pressure is known to accelerate (AHA, n.d-c.).
Alcohol consumption increases blood pressure by increasing the level of the hormone renin in the blood. Renin decreases fluid elimination, causing higher fluid volume in the body and arterial vasoconstriction that results in an increase in blood pressure. Reducing alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 12 mm Hg (Wake, 2021).
Relaxation Techniques
According to Harvard Health Publishing (2022), meditation has been associated with reducing blood pressure. Herawati et al. (2023) adds that slow breathing can be used as a nonpharmacological treatment to lower blood pressure. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (2021) reviewed research on relaxation and blood pressure control that showed relaxation techniques resulted in small reductions in blood pressure and demonstrated yoga may be used as an adjunct intervention for the management of hypertension.
Assessing Client Lifestyle Modifications
The nurse should work closely with the client to promote lifestyle changes—such as diet modifications and weight loss, increase in exercise, smoking cessation, and use of relaxation techniques—that will improve baseline blood pressure readings.
Self-Monitoring of Hypertension
Home blood pressure monitoring () contributes to the comprehension of hypertension and facilitates the awareness of the importance of blood pressure management. Clients are now able to monitor their blood pressure with electronic blood pressure devices. Home blood pressure monitoring leads to awareness of one’s blood pressure, better blood pressure control, and adherence to lifestyle changes and drug therapies (Verma et al., 2021).
Daily blood pressure monitoring at home allows clients to better manage their blood pressure. (credit: “Arm Band Blood Pressure Monitor” by Alabama Extension/flickr, Public Domain)
Pharmacologic Treatment of Hypertension
Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension centers on the individual client and takes into consideration their lifestyle as well as their personal, social, and cultural preferences. The objectives of pharmacological treatment are to reduce blood pressure and reduce the long-term effects of hypertension like organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics (Khalil & Zeltser, 2022) are the primary antihypertensive drugs used to treat high blood pressure. These drugs are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
Assessing Therapeutic Effects
The nurse should monitor the client’s blood pressure to assess for drug efficacy. If blood pressure remains elevated despite antihypertensive treatment, the health care provider may adjust antihypertensive drugs to better control the client’s blood pressure.

Grades of Hypertension
The American Heart Association (AHA) (n.d-a.) reports that prolonged elevation of blood pressure leads to the deterioration of blood vessels. The deterioration of blood vessels is measured by grades of hypertension. Normal blood pressure is a systolic reading of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading of less than 80 mm Hg.

A physical examination by a health care provider with a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff or device) will identify an elevated blood pressure, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can assist in determining if the heart has a normal or abnormal rhythm. The health care provider also obtains blood work to determine factors that contribute to the client’s hypertension as well as how the body is reacting to elevated blood pressure. These laboratory tests include a complete blood cell count (CBC), basic electrolyte panel, cholesterol panel, and renal function. An echocardiogram—an ultrasound of the heart—is not typically included in diagnostic procedures to determine hypertension; however, the health care provider may add this diagnostic study to visualize the heart’s chambers, valves, and pumping action to determine the effect of hypertension on the heart, which may cause other disorders such as hypertrophy of the heart. The health care provider bases the diagnosis for hypertension on the findings of the physical examination and the diagnostic study results.

Clinical Manifestations
Symptoms of hypertension may not occur for years, and most of the time, the symptoms can be silent. Symptoms typically associated with hypertension include elevated blood pressure readings, headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological disturbances such as disorientation or a decreased level of consciousness. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to organ damage. Clients can experience symptoms related to the specific organ that is damaged; for example, if hypertension is left untreated, it may cause renal insufficiency, which may then continue to deteriorate, causing kidney damage and leading to end-stage renal disease that requires dialysis.

Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Hypertension
Nonpharmacologic measures used to treat hypertension center around lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes focus on the client’s personal, social, and cultural influences. These changes may include diet modification, increased physical activity and exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption reduction, relaxation techniques, and self-monitoring.
The AHA conducted a critical assessment of research and clinical knowledge on cardiovascular disease across the United States specifically addressing women’s health. In its report to the president, gaps were identified and actions outlined to optimize cardiovascular health in women across their lifespans, with the goal of reaching health equity in health care (Wenger et al., 2022). The AHA has deployed awareness campaigns that are culturally sensitive and focus on the optimization of preventive and clinical care. Community engagement and advocacy in policy change at the legislative level have been encouraged.
In a fireside video chat, The Heart of the Matter: Racial and Gender Bias in Cardiovascular Care, presented by Abbott Cardiovascular, an expert panel of health care providers and representatives discusses cardiovascular care. The panel identifies gender and racial bias as negatively impacting the client experience for persons with coronary and peripheral artery disease. The chat covers not only cardiovascular health but also technologies that may be utilized to bridge the critical gaps identified.
Dietary Modification
Clients with hypertension should eat a low-sodium diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other recommendations include low-fat dairy products and limiting meat intake to about two servings daily of lean meat, such as fish and poultry (Challa & Ameer, 2023). Reducing sweets and red meat is also important. The AHA (n.d-b) recommends 1,500 mg to no more than 2,300 mg of sodium intake daily. Dietary patterns and nutritional therapy should focus on food preferences, social and cultural influences, and appropriate caloric intake.
Physical Activity and Exercise
The AHA (n.d-d.) recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity weekly. Average time for exercise should be at least 30–40 minutes per session to assist in decreasing blood pressure. If the client cannot do 30–40 minutes of moderate exercise four times a week, the nurse should suggest an alternate exercise plan, emphasizing that some physical activity is better than no physical activity. Physical activity and exercise enhance weight reduction and promote a healthy lifestyle.
Smoking Cessation and Reducing Alcohol Consumption
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of coronary artery disease. Smoking increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes vasoconstriction and, therefore, increases blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial contractility. Although smoking has been established as a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its relationship to high blood pressure is still being investigated. Nevertheless, smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke contribute to increased accumulation of fatty deposits within the arteries, which high blood pressure is known to accelerate (AHA, n.d-c.).
Alcohol consumption increases blood pressure by increasing the level of the hormone renin in the blood. Renin decreases fluid elimination, causing higher fluid volume in the body and arterial vasoconstriction that results in an increase in blood pressure. Reducing alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 12 mm Hg (Wake, 2021).
Relaxation Techniques
According to Harvard Health Publishing (2022), meditation has been associated with reducing blood pressure. Herawati et al. (2023) adds that slow breathing can be used as a nonpharmacological treatment to lower blood pressure. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (2021) reviewed research on relaxation and blood pressure control that showed relaxation techniques resulted in small reductions in blood pressure and demonstrated yoga may be used as an adjunct intervention for the management of hypertension.
Assessing Client Lifestyle Modifications
The nurse should work closely with the client to promote lifestyle changes—such as diet modifications and weight loss, increase in exercise, smoking cessation, and use of relaxation techniques—that will improve baseline blood pressure readings.
Self-Monitoring of Hypertension
Home blood pressure monitoring () contributes to the comprehension of hypertension and facilitates the awareness of the importance of blood pressure management. Clients are now able to monitor their blood pressure with electronic blood pressure devices. Home blood pressure monitoring leads to awareness of one’s blood pressure, better blood pressure control, and adherence to lifestyle changes and drug therapies (Verma et al., 2021).

Pharmacologic Treatment of Hypertension
Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension centers on the individual client and takes into consideration their lifestyle as well as their personal, social, and cultural preferences. The objectives of pharmacological treatment are to reduce blood pressure and reduce the long-term effects of hypertension like organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics (Khalil & Zeltser, 2022) are the primary antihypertensive drugs used to treat high blood pressure. These drugs are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
Assessing Therapeutic Effects
The nurse should monitor the client’s blood pressure to assess for drug efficacy. If blood pressure remains elevated despite antihypertensive treatment, the health care provider may adjust antihypertensive drugs to better control the client’s blood pressure.

Angina
Angina (also called angina pectoris) is characterized by discomfort in the front of the chest, neck, shoulders, jaw, or arms that is precipitated by physical exertions and relieved by rest within 5 minutes or sublingual nitrates (Ueng et al., 2023). Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The four types of angina (AHA, 2022a) are listed below:
Stable angina is the most common form. It often occurs during activity and may sometimes occur at rest. Stable angina is predictable and follows a pattern of similar episodes of chest pain.
Unstable angina is unpredictable and considered a medical emergency. Unlike stable angina, unstable angina usually occurs during rest and does not follow a pattern of similar episodes of chest pain; episodes may last longer than stable angina episodes. If blood flow to the heart does not improve, a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur.
Variant (Prinzmetal) angina, unlike the other forms of angina, is not caused by coronary artery disease but rather by a spasm in the heart’s arteries that temporarily decreases blood flow and almost always occurs at rest. 
Microvascular angina is frequent episodes of angina that occur due to coronary microvascular disease.
Risk factors for stable, unstable, and microvascular angina include age, family history, tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Risk factors for Prinzmetal angina may be caused by anything that leads to spasms of the coronary arteries including certain medications such as decongestants, use of substances such as cannabis and cocaine, smoking tobacco, and stress (AHA, 2022a).
Pharmacologic Treatment of Angina
Pharmacologic treatment for angina is individualized. Client lifestyle, as well as social and cultural influences, impact the health care provider’s treatment choice. The goal for pharmacologic treatment of stable angina is to prevent an ischemic event—like myocardial ischemia or infarction (heart attack)—from occurring. Nitrates are the first line of treatment for angina along with beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers (Rousan & Thadani, 2019). Both types of blockers will be discussed further in this chapter.

Diagnostic Studies for Angina Diagnostic studies for angina include a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for ST-segment changes, a stress test to evaluate the heart’s response to physical exertion, and coronary angiography to visualize the coronary arteries and identify any blockages. Treatment for Angina Treatment for angina includes lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy, and, in some cases, revascularization procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Lifestyle modifications for angina are similar to those for hypertension and include dietary changes, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and stress management. Pharmacologic therapy for angina may include nitroglycerin to relieve acute episodes of chest pain, beta-blockers to reduce the heart’s workload, calcium channel blockers to dilate coronary arteries, and antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots. Revascularization procedures such as PCI or CABG may be considered for individuals with severe coronary artery disease that is not adequately managed with lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy. Conclusion In conclusion, hypertension and angina are both cardiovascular conditions that require comprehensive management strategies. Understanding the pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnostic studies, and treatment options for these conditions is essential for healthcare providers to effectively care for individuals with these conditions. By implementing lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate diagnostic studies, healthcare providers can help individuals with hypertension and angina achieve better control of their conditions and reduce the risk of complications.","coronary arteries such as eosue to cod stress, mication or du se iansic tdie for ngina ianstic stuies for angina inclu a lead electrcardiga  to asess fo Tseget hanes a tress test to eauae he hearts resnse to ysca eertion an orryngoahy t sae the orona ateries a ietiy n ockags.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Identify the characteristics of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs used to treat hypertension.
Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs used to treat hypertension.
Describe nursing implications of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs used to treat hypertension.
Explain the client education related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs used to treat hypertension.

Introduction and Use
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a classification of drugs that block the body’s production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces oxidative stress and inflammation of cardiac tissue, which contributes to adverse remodeling processes. Angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, stimulating catecholamine release. The release of catecholamine decreases urinary excretion of sodium and water, which then causes the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone stimulates the hypertrophy of the vascular smooth muscles, causing thickening of the vascular smooth muscle wall and restricting blood flow. ACE inhibitors (see ) are used to treat hypertension and cardiovascular diseases by reducing the release of aldosterone as part of the first line of treatment for clients who have hypertension (Goyal et al., 2022).
Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels; ACE inhibitors reverse thickening of the heart muscle. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license.)
ACE Inhibitors
Some clients with hypertension demonstrate a lower response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy. ACE inhibitors interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes high blood pressure when renin levels are high. Black clients often have hypertension, but also have lower levels of renin. Therefore, concomitant therapy may be required to increase response to antihypertensive therapies.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
ACE inhibitors are relatively safe to use and have a low incidence of serious adverse effects. Adverse effects include angioedema, nonproductive cough, neutropenia (low neutrophils in the blood), agranulocytosis (low granulocytes in the blood), proteinuria (protein in the urine), and rash. Clients may develop an ACE inhibitor–associated cough (a persistent, dry, itchy cough), hyperkalemia (elevated potassium level in the blood), or hypotension (Jun et al., 2021).
ACE inhibitors should not be taken during pregnancy. Clients with renal impairment should use them cautiously. Clients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to an ACE inhibitor should not be prescribed this classification of drug.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ACE inhibitors:
Assess the client’s blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during drug therapy.
Monitor serum potassium levels for hyperkalemia.
Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client teaching guidelines.
ACE Inhibitors
Taking ACE inhibitors with potassium-containing salt substitutes or consuming large amounts of high potassium foods increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Having a blood potassium level above 6.0 mmol/L is considered a medical emergency and can result in cardiac arrest.
The client taking an ACE inhibitor should:
Avoid foods high in potassium and salt substitutes (because these are high in potassium) due to the aldosterone release.
Report side effects such as low blood pressure, cough, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, sore throat, swelling of the eyes and lips, or difficulty breathing to their health care provider.
Notify their health care provider if pregnant, planning on getting pregnant, or breastfeeding before starting an ACE inhibitor.
Report symptoms such as chest pain, slurred speech, hemiparesis, and difficulty speaking or walking to their health care provider immediately because these may be symptoms of a heart attack or stroke.
Be aware that a persistent cough may develop when taking ACE inhibitors.
ACE Inhibitors
The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death.

Introduction and Use
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a classification of drug that binds to and inhibits angiotensin II type I receptors. Renin secretion catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin in the liver where it is then converted to angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme.
ARBs resemble ACE inhibitors in how they affect blood pressure and the cardiovascular system. However, there are three notable differences: ARBs are less likely than ACE inhibitors to cause a chronic cough (Carter, 2022); the risk of angioedema is decreased with ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors; and, ARBs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and heart failure.

 Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of ARBs include dizziness, muscle cramps, weakness, heartburn, diarrhea, leg swelling, headaches, and weight loss. Serious adverse effects include angioedema, hypotension, hepatic impairment, and hyperkalemia.
ARBs
The renin-angiotensin system has been associated with increased risk of mood disorders. The use of ARBs may be associated with an increased risk of suicide compared with other antihypertensive therapies (Sanches & Teixeira, 2021). Hypertensive clients with low renin (sometimes seen more often in Black client populations) demonstrate a lower response to ARB monotherapy. Concomitant therapy may be required to increase response to antihypertensive therapies. Older adults (65 years and older) and clients with hepatic impairment should start on a low initial dose because ARBs are metabolized by the liver.
(Source: Colvin et al., 2020)
ARBs should not be taken during pregnancy. Clients with hepatic impairment should use ARBs cautiously. Clients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction or angioedema to an ARB should not be prescribed this classification of drug. Clients with a history of mood disturbances or who are at risk for mood disturbances should be monitored closely for suicidal ideation.
ARBs
ARBs can have teratogenic effects (causing harm to the embryo or fetus), so clients should avoid being pregnant while taking an ARB.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ARBs:
Monitor the client’s blood pressure as prescribed.
Monitor the client for interactions because many medications and herbal supplements interact with ARBs.
Monitor the client for adverse effects, including electrolyte imbalances and alterations in liver and renal function.
Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client teaching guidelines.
The client taking an ARB should:
Avoid foods high in potassium and salt substitutes (because these are high in potassium).
Report side effects such as low blood pressure, cough, heart palpitations, fever, chills, sore throat, swelling of lips or face, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing to the health care provider.
Notify their health care provider if they experience abdominal pain, joint or muscle aches, muscle weakness, change in the amount of urine produced, or trouble breathing.
Notify their health care provider if pregnant, planning on getting pregnant, or breastfeeding before starting an ARB.

Identify the characteristics of the beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.
Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.
Describe nursing implications of beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.
Explain the client education related to beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.

Introduction and Use
Beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are a classification of drugs that inhibit chronotropic, inotropic, and vasoconstrictor response to catecholamine—such as epinephrine and norepinephrine—by exerting effects on adrenergic receptors beta 1, beta 2, and alpha.
Beta 1 receptors are found primarily in the heart and kidneys, and they increase the heart rate, myocardial activity, and release of renin. Beta 2 receptors are found in the smooth muscle tissue of the heart, lungs, and nervous system and increase myocardial contractility and cause muscle tremors. Alpha receptors stimulate vasoconstriction.
Beta blockers are classified as either nonselective or cardio-selective. Nonselective beta blockers affect both beta 1 and beta 2 and act on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Cardio-selective beta blockers, in contrast, affect beta 1, which impacts the cardiovascular system (Tucker et al., 2022).
Beta blockers decrease heart rate, decrease myocardial contractility, and decrease the rate of conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, thereby lowering blood pressure and heart rate. Beta blockers also cause vasodilation and decrease the release of renin and angiotensin II, promoting excretion of sodium and water from the body. Beta blockers are relatively safe for use. Beta blockers treat clients with hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, migraines, glaucoma, and certain types of tremors. Beta blockers have also been used by health care providers as anxiolytics (to reduce anxiety).
Most beta blockers are taken orally. Labetalol, metoprolol, and propranolol can be administered intravenously. Extended-release beta blockers should not be crushed. Nurses should monitor blood pressure and pulse rate of clients using beta blockers. Beta blockers should not be administered if the client is hypotensive or has a heart rate of less than 60 (Farzam & Jan, 2022).
Beta Blockers
Beta blockers pose an ethical dilemma for health care providers because they cause anxiolytic effects. The FDA, however, does not support this use for beta blockers. The health care provider may prescribe beta blockers off-label (against FDA-approved labeling indications for drug use) for anxiety. Therefore, the prescribed use of beta blockers for anxiolysis should be weighed against standards of practice as well as risks and benefits to the client.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of beta blockers are dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold hands and feet, hypercholesterolemia, shortness of breath, depression, nausea, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Serious adverse effects include bradycardia, arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. Rare side effects include sexual and erectile dysfunction.
Beta blockers are contraindicated in clients with moderate to severe asthma and/or chronic lung diseases due to the potential for causing an exacerbation. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in clients with AV node and sinus bradycardia because they can aggravate these conditions. Beta blockers may exacerbate symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon or cause this disease process in clients. Diabetics should use beta blockers cautiously because they can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, causing confusion, fainting, or seizures.

Assessing Comorbidities: Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Diabetes
Nurses should always assess a client’s comorbidities—such as asthma, COPD, and diabetes—before administering beta blocker drugs. To prevent a pharmacological drug interaction, the nurse must assess whether clients are taking short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) because beta blockers can reduce their effectiveness. Additionally, nurses should be aware that beta blockers can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic clients.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking beta-adrenergic blockers:
Assess the client’s blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during drug therapy.
Do not administer the drug if the client’s heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute and notify the health care provider.
Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client teaching guidelines.
The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should:
Take their pulse as directed before taking a beta-adrenergic blocker and do not administer the drug if the pulse is less than 60 beats/minute or as directed by their health care provider.
Understand that beta-adrenergic blockers can induce hyperglycemia. Diabetic clients should monitor blood glucose levels closely.
Take this medication without regard to meals.
Report side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, or sexual dysfunction to their health care provider.
Monitor for symptoms of worsening heart failure such as fatigue, weight gain, and peripheral edema.
The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should not:
Take beta-adrenergic blockers with OTC drugs or herbal supplements such as ma-huang, ephedra, black cohosh, hawthorn, or licorice without consulting their health care provider because these supplements may interfere with the action of the beta-adrenergic blocker.
Discontinue use without speaking with the health care provider first because this may cause exacerbation of angina and myocardial infarction.
Beta-Adrenergic Blockers
Beta blocker therapy should not be abruptly stopped but gradually tapered to avoid exacerbation of angina and myocardial infarction. Seek health care provider advice before discontinuing use.

Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the calcium channel blocker drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.
Describe nursing implications of calcium channel blocker drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.
Explain the client education related to calcium channel blocker drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.

Introduction and Use
Calcium channel blockers are a classification of drug that blocks calcium from entering cells by binding to long-acting voltage-gated calcium channels in the heart, smooth muscle, and pancreas. Calcium causes vasoconstriction. Calcium channel blockers inhibit calcium and allow for vasodilation, thereby causing the heart rate to slow and blood pressure to lower. Calcium channel blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias.
Calcium channel blockers are classified as dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridines. Dihydropyridines are peripheral vasodilators that lower blood pressure and heart rate; they are used to treat post-intracranial hemorrhage, vasospasm, and migraines. In addition to their action on the peripheral vasculature, nondihydropyridines inhibit the sinoatrial and AV nodes, slowing cardiac conduction and heart rate, and decreasing oxygen demand.
Calcium channel blockers may be used alone or in combination with other drugs. They are highly protein bound, which increases the volume of distribution within the body. Calcium channel blockers are available in long- and short-acting formulas.
Calcium Channel Blockers
Calcium channel blockers are among the most effective antihypertensive classification of drug for use in non-Hispanic Black adults.

Introduction and Use
Diuretics are a classification of drug that induces sodium loss and increase urine flow. They are typically used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and volume overload states. This chapter will cover diuretics as they are prescribed for hypertension and coronary heart disorders, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics. (Loop diuretics, which are also prescribed for heart failure, are discussed in Heart Failure Drugs.
FDA Blood Pressure Booklet
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides a client-oriented webpage listing FDA-approved products currently available to treat hypertension. It provides links to drug classifications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. A high blood pressure medicines booklet also is available for download.
Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics
Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubules. These diuretics increase the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, producing diuresis in the client, and also create a potassium loss within the body. Along with ACE inhibitors, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are often the first line of treatment for clients diagnosed with hypertension and may be used in conjunction with other antihypertensive drugs (Akbari & Khorasani-Zadeh, 2022).
 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
Potassium-sparing diuretics antagonize aldosterone. These drugs reduce aldosterone-induced sodium and water retention in the late distal tubules of the kidneys. These types of diuretics retain potassium within the body; therefore, potassium does not need to be supplemented. Potassium-sparing diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure but should be used cautiously in clients with impaired renal function.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking diuretics:
Assess the client’s blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during drug therapy.
Assess the client for electrolyte imbalances and hyperglycemia as well as the client’s urine output. Urine output for an adult should be weight based at 0.5 mL/kg/hour.
Assess and monitor for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See the chart below for client teaching guidelines.
The client taking a diuretic should:
Take diuretics early in the morning to avoid increased urination during the night and sleep disturbance.
Take diuretics with food to avoid GI upset, nausea, and vomiting.
Report a weight loss or weight gain greater than 2 pounds a day or 5 pounds a week to their health care provider.
The client taking a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic should:
Report side effects such as low blood pressure, fatigue, bleeding, hypokalemia, weakness, rash, and leg cramps to their health care provider.
Eat potassium-rich foods such as avocados, bananas, and spinach to replace potassium.
If diabetic, monitor their blood glucose levels carefully due to these diuretics’ effects on carbohydrate metabolism.
The client taking a potassium-sparing diuretic should:
Avoid exposure to direct sunlight because spironolactone can cause photosensitivity.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
Identify the characteristics of the nitrate drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.
Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the nitrate drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.
Describe nursing implications of nitrate drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.
Explain the client education related to nitrate drugs used to treat hypertension and angina

Introduction and Use
Nitrates are a classification of drugs that cause vasodilation of blood vessels, which relaxes smooth muscles and causes the dilation of coronary vessels. Vasodilation improves oxygen supply to the heart, decreases oxygen demand within the body, reduces cardiac workload (preload and afterload), and lowers blood pressure. Nitrates have been used to treat chest pain and angina since the early 1800s. Nitrates come in different forms including oral, sublingual, translingual spray, intravenous, topical, and transdermal and can be short-acting or long-acting. Nitrates are commonly used to treat angina, acute coronary syndrome, arterial hypertension, and heart failure (Lee & Gerriets, 2022).
Nitrates
Older clients using nitrates are at a higher risk for postural hypotension and should rise from a lying or sitting position slowly to prevent falls and injuries.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects for nitrates include headache, lightheadedness, flushing, syncope, reflex tachycardia, and dizziness. Serious adverse effects include hypotension.
Contraindications include allergies to nitrates, concomitant use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as tadalafil and sildenafil, history of right ventricular infarction, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nitrates should be used cautiously in clients on long-term diuretic therapy, with low systolic blood pressure, with autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Nitrates
Nitrates can induce hypotension. They should not be taken with PDE inhibitors because they can cause severe hypotension and cardiac decompensation.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking nitrates:
Carefully assess the client for drug and herbal supplement interactions because they may cause profound hypotension.
Assess and monitor the client’s blood pressure during initial dosing and intermittently throughout drug therapy, especially if administering nitrates intravenously, because they may cause severe hypotension.
Do not administer nitrates if the client’s systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg and if the heart rate is greater than 100 beats/minute. Notify the health care provider.
Adhere to health care provider instructions on how and when to administer this classification of drug or when to hold the drug.
Assess adverse effects and therapeutic effects.
Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client teaching guidelines.
The client taking a sublingual nitrate should:
Take sublingual nitrates if chest pain occurs. They should take one sublingual nitrate every 5 minutes times three doses if chest pain persists. If chest pain continues, the client should call 911.
Store sublingual nitrate bottles away from the light in a dry place and in the original amber glass bottle.
The client using nitrate patches should:
Apply patches once daily as a maintenance medication.
Avoid hairy areas when applying nitrate patches.
Remove nitrate patches for 10–12 hours before placing a new one to prevent tolerance.
Rotate sites of nitrate patches to prevent skin irritation.
The client using a nitrate should not:
Use patches for acute chest pain.
Take erectile dysfunction medications because this may cause profound hypotension.
Other Concerns
Headaches may occur with the use of nitrates. Acetaminophen may help in relieving these headaches.
If low blood pressure develops, the client should lie on their back with legs elevated and notify their health care provider.
Part C
Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up from Case Study Parts A and B.
Ms. Tran is following up with the health care provider 3 months after her initial diagnosis of hypertension stage 2. She reports her headaches and dizziness have improved; however, she is now reporting chest pain when she walks 1–2 miles. The chest pain is relieved by resting on a park bench. Ms. Tran states she experiences a burning in her chest that does not radiate to other areas. Ms. Tran denies nausea, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, or dizziness with chest pain.
The nurse performs a 12-lead ECG on Ms. Tran, as ordered. The health care provider notes that there are no ischemic changes and diagnoses Ms. Tran with stable angina. The health care provider prescribes verapamil 40 mg orally three times daily and nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually for chest pain. The nurse is developing a teaching care plan for Ms. Tran.

This chapter focused on antihypertension and antianginal drugs. Hypertension and angina were defined. Stroke volume and peripheral vascular resistance are the two determinants of blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was described and how it impacts blood pressure within the body was explained. Blood pressure guidelines by the American Heart Association were discussed. The types of angina were briefly explained along with typical findings.
Common antihypertensive and antianginal drug classifications were covered in the chapters. Drug classifications covered included ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and nitrates. These drug classifications are used as mono- or multi-drug treatment therapy for hypertension and angina.
